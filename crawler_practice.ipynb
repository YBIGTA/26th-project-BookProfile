       "  'description': \"Could you survive on your own in the wild, with every one out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?\\n\\nIn the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.\\n\\nSixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.\",\n",

       "    'review': 'Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book.\\nTwo reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote:\\nBecause Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She skewers that apple in the pig\\'s mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I love this book because - despite being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* (*)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book.\\n\\nKatniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don\\'t include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being \"Lover Boy\", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who\\'d do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah...\\n\\n...Rue...Oh, Rue...\\n\\n\\nNow, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Whose\\nbrought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care.\\n\\nSuzanne Collins strictly follows the rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.\\n----------\\nI enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets .\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence\\'s Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'Dystopian Perfection.\\n\\nIn a post-apocalyptic future, life has turned extremely hard. Fighting poverty and hunger every day, sixteen years old hunter Katniss does absolutely everything in her power to have enough for her defenseless little sister, and a barely lucid mother. Life is hard, yet not impossible, until the one fateful day arrives. Once every year, the ever vigilant all powerful Capitol of Panem celebrates for their entertainment the “Hunger Games”, a yearly tournament where a handful representatives of each district are forced to fight in a massive arena, to the death. In a sad turn of events, young Katniss will have to fight not only for herself, but for the future of her starving family.\\n\\nI think this series needs as much introduction as Lord of the Rings; but what the hey, old habits die hard. Maybe not everyone has read it, maybe not everyone has watched it, but doubt anyone has never heard of it at some point. One of the greatest dystopian fiction of all time, or at least one of the best-selling ones. A literature masterpiece? Hardly. One of the most entertaining ever? Quite possibly! Astounding world building and character development. Not a profound reading at all, but a plot perfectly balanced, fast paced and action packed; if you can withstand YA that is, and the triangle thingy. Along with Percy Jackson and Divergent, one of the pillar series that sparked my literary addiction. Highly Recommendable.\\n\\n*** Hunger Games (2012) is a superb adaptation, maybe as good as the book, if not better. Highly popcorn and re-watch worthy. I don’t normally reread, or feel the desire to; but lost count of how many times I’ve watched the movie on TV. It just never gets old, and is perfect, for what it is; really bringing the characters alive in a way a book never can, and few adaptations ever succeed. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson just marvelous in their roles, with an unforgettably heartbreaking performance by Amandla Stenberg as Rue too. Still, even a decade later I can never forget that Madge Undersee was left out of the adaptation; and the Tessera system hardly explained or mentioned; along with a few other minor things cut out. Not one of the greatest films but one of the greatest adaptations ever, hands down. One of those few cases where I think I ultimately prefer the movie rather than the book. Extremely Recommendable.\\n\\nTeam Peeta btw.\\n\\nAlso. Fatniss I’m scared! <3\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n:\\n[2008] [374p] [Dystopia] [YA] [4.5] [Highly Recommendable]\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n★★★★★ [4.5]\\n★★★★★\\n★★★★☆ [3.5]\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\nEn un futuro post apocalíptico, la vida se ha vuelto extremadamente dura. Luchando contra la pobreza y el hambre cada día, la cazadora Katniss de dieciséis años hace todo lo humanamente posible en su poder para tener lo suficiente para su indefensa pequeña hermana, y una apenas lúcida madre. La vida es difícil, pero no imposible, hasta que un día llega el fatídico día. Una vez cada año, el siempre vigilante y todo poderoso Capitolio de Panem celebra para su entretenimiento los “Juegos del Hambre”, un evento anual en una masiva arena donde un puñado de representantes de cada distrito son forzados a lugar, hasta la muerte. En un triste giro de eventos, la joven Katniss deberԕ luchar no sólo por sí misma, sino por el futuro de su hambrienta familia.\\n\\nCreo que esta serie necesita tanta introducción como El Señor de los Anillos; pero qué demonios, los viejos hábitos nunca descansan. Tal vez no todos lo hayan leído, tal vez no todos lo hayan visto, pero dudo que nadie no haya escuchado hablarlo en algún momento. Una de las más grandes ficciones distópicas de toda la historia, o al menos de las que mejor vendieron ¿Una obra maestra literaria? Difícilmente ¿Una de las más entretenidas jamás? Muy probablemente. Increíble construcción de mundo y desarrollo de personajes. No una lectura muy profunda en absoluto, pero con una trama perfectamente balanceada, rápida en el ritmo y cargada de acción; si podés soportar lo Joven Adulto claro, y el coso ese del triángulo. Junto con Percy Jackson y Divergente, una de las series pilares que encendieron mi adicción literaria. Altamente Recomendable.\\n\\n*** Los Juegos del Hambre (2012) es una sobresaliente adaptación, tal vez tan buena como el libro, sino mejor. Altamente digna de palomitas y volver a ver una y otra vez. Normalmente nunca releo, ni siento el deseo; pero perdí la cuenta de cuántas veces he visto la película por TV. Nunca se gasta, y es perfecta, para lo que es; realmente trayendo a la vida a los personajes de una forma que un libro nunca puede, y pocas adaptaciones llegan a lograr. Jennifer Lawrence y Josh Hutcherson absolutamente maravillosos en sus roles, con una inolvidablemente desgarradora actuación de Amandla Stenberg como Rue también. Igual, incluso una década después no puedo olvidar que cortaron a Madge Undersee fuera la trama; y el sistema de las Teselas apenas explicado o mencionado; entre otras pequeñas cosas que quedaron fuera. No una de las mejores películas pero sí una de las mejores adaptaciones jamás, sin duda. Uno de esos casos donde creo que en última instancia prefiero la película sobre el libro. Extremadamente Recomendable.\\n\\nEquipo Peeta por cierto.\\n\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n:\\n[2008] [374p] [Distopía] [Joven Adulto] [4.5] [Altamente Recomendable]\\n-----------------------------------------------'},\n",

       "    'review': \"I was forced into watching Mockingjay: Part II this weekend. To clarify, I watched the second part of the last Hunger Games movie without having read any of the books, without having watched any of the movies.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I was confused as fuck.\\n\\nSo many questions and thoughts ran through my mind as I watched the movie. Why is Peeta so thin? Did that huge-ass bruise really disappear from her neck the next day? Is Katniss to look like she's about to burst into tears at any given moment, or is that just Jennifer Lawrence? Woody Harrelson is in this movie? Hey, it's Margaery from Game of Thrones! Who's President Snow? What's a Mockingjay? Lesser Hemsworth is pretty hot.\\n\\nWell, you get the point. I know how the book ended and I still have no idea who anyone is, and neither do I know their names, with the exception of Peeta, Gale, President Snow, that Coin woman, and Katniss. Of course, knowing how the book ended means I probably should read the first book, so\\n\\nAnd it was good. It was really good. My sister was right (she usually is).\\n\\nWhat else can I say that hasn't already been said? I loved it. The world building was interesting (although it helps that I've seen what it looks like on the big screen), and Katniss is . One of the things my sister didn't like about the first movie is that the on-screen Katniss was different from her portrayal in the first book. I haven't watched that movie, but I kind of see how the screen portrayal of Katniss might have bothered her. Book-Katniss is strong, kick-ass without being a Mary Sue. She has a fierce love for her sister, and she is manipulative and cunning. She uses the prospect of romance to protect herself, she has no qualms about using people, and I love that about her.\\n\\nTime to watch Movie #1!\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"A lot of things are troubling me about The Hunger Games. A lot of things which I more and more perceive and which are not solely connected with this book but with the metaphor behind the words. People attach themselves to fictional freedom without seeing what really something is and which unfortunately is here to stay because you can't wake a person who is pretending to be asleep. You can’t make a shift on a deeper level, if the only thing that attracts you to this book is – a vision of fight, retaliation and the outcome of freedom. Freedom of flesh.\\n\\nIn comparison to the freedom of and from your mind which is nowhere to be found.\\n\\nAnd this is why I detest this book, although detest is such a strong from the ego word. Because the whole purpose of this story is to show how people shouldn’t sacrifice their children for the better of their communities and with the positive outcomes realise that we are so much stronger and yada yada.\\n\\nTHE WHOLE PURPOSE of this book should be that there shouldn’t even be in the first place a need to sacrifice members of our society for some other people to be amused. And where after the battle of ''united'' people we heal and repair the damages for the better tomorrow. The society cancer of western civilisation thinking.\\n\\nHeal the damage, never heal the cause of it.\\n\\nBut then we wouldn’t be talking here about the same book. We would be discussing how humanity can help each other with being better, with taking responsibility and with being open to each other.\\n\\nAnd yet imagine this paradox we live in: better, as if the majority of population can even understand that we are in constant blood thirst to achieve peace. With war comes peace. While along the way we are trying to be better and safer. Yet most people deliberately choose to live on the utmost lowest level of their existence. In fear, frightened of itself.\\n\\nAnd people read books which are so extreme in their bullshit. And people connect with Katniss because she is the heroine. She has managed to outsmart the system. Instead of thinking that she was not even supposed be there in the first place. Because we live in society that does this to their children.\\n\\n''No, we don’t!''\\n\\n''We do...''\\n\\n''But children can learn how to fight.''\\n\\n''You teach them to fight for individual puppeteers. And instead of working on yourself, how to achieve your inner peace, you associate yourself again with the group because it feels better to be in the tortured crowd, instead of being alone and awakened.''\\n\\n''What are you talking about? It is just emo gibberish. Leave Katniss alone. And in the end, it is just a book. Why don’t you want people to read and educate themselves, does everything have to be deep and meaningful, can’t you just relax?''\\n\\nYes, everything has to be deep and meaningful since we are drowning in shit of meaningless and shallow. The system as it is, the plot of this book is just another evidence to show us how we are controlled. That we are left barren from our true selves which we only find in empathy, love towards each other and genuinely understanding that we are one and everything is one. But on this provincial&marginal&primitive&emotional level, so many took this book for granted.\\n\\nAnd the only reason I am writing this review here, the only reason I am giving it so much attention is to tell what is on my mind since it is so widely popular and since I have read it. And one of the main reasons why I can’t really keep things light and popsy is because so many things are already deep down in gutter light and popsy and mainstream. As if having money is any critieria for life, as if not having your own free will and education and information means nothing. And the other side of the rich coin is poverty with people who believe in symbols, who are sidetracked with religions, censured TV, economy and utter lack of information circulation.\\n\\nAnd a lot of people here are trying to disregard this review and want to reassure me that I am so terribly wrong. BUT, you have yet not seen what I am talking about and it is perfectly OK.\\n\\nSo I followed as well screaming Goodreads recommendations and I bought a book that is stupid, violent and written so plainly but of course written for vast masses so they can be touched by fake social awareness. Because it is fake, but most of all it’s tragic.\\n\\nAnd this is not a critique toward Collins, in my nature of a thinker and seeing her a person who shared her thoughts and which millions of people loved and connected with, I am still a firm believer that the general public just didn’t understand what she was talking about. And this is my silver lining. Because it has been like this throughout centuries and with the biggest thinkers of our civilisation. What they meant and wanted to show, is definitely not what most of the public projected.\\n\\nBecause the mainstream public is a group of sheep, not seeing anything properly, but following and like a Tarzan, screaming, don’t you dare stealing my Jane from me. As a metaphor, don’t you dare telling me these uplifting emotions are not true, when all in me about this book tells me that is correct and how people should live their lives.\\n\\nAnd if the mainstream likes it, uh, then definitely that is not what it’s true.\\n\\nIt is just a constant reminder how so many things are left unrecognised while these superficial stories which evoke cheap emotions are always so hugely praised. It could have been just a little story but never underestimate the obese octopus that is called In God And Country We Trust - code red mentality. Mentality of humans which are too ignorant, beautifully naive and untouched basically with what is means to be socially aware.\\n\\nAnd although this is a teen book, it is more deeply hurting and sickening because if you want to influence somebody, of course you will influence the children – and yet there is nothing that children can learn from it. They can learn some things, we all need little courageous Katniss, but on a deeper subtler level is it just an intravenous injection of more Nothing and more Numbing and more Disconnected.\\n\\nAt least they read is one of the arguments. And argument as fruitfull as at least they eat GMO food. One food for the blind intellect, other for the digestion which both results in basic survival without any interference of you in all of it. Because it takes courage and guts and a pinch of anarchy to stop, turn around and start questioning what is handed.\\n\\nFor me, the thought about giving this to a child is sickening especially because we live in this world where all the life criterias are upside down. Because a child will not learn how things are vile and disturbing because Katniss told them through her delusional and hyperventilating focus, but a child will learn about life’s cruelty, and it will be touched by it sooner or later, by questioning everything that is served in front of it.\\n\\nBecause if it is served somebody is earning money and you are just getting fatter and sicker.\\n\\nAnd the children will learn how to question if you teach them how to find not if you broadcast them the answers. Not if you teach them through aggressive examples and if you keep the nation in cold sweat especially if you are lucky enough to live in the countries where oppression is not the issue but consumerism, body image and mediocrity have you on the leash.\\n\\nI am astonished with a fact that around 75.000 Goodreads members read this book and that around 50.000 of them rated it 5 stars. What is it that fascinates them so much.\\n\\nIt’s disturbing because people obviously associate and find themselves in this book. And it's about a girl Katniss Everdeen, living in the far away future, who was chosen to participate in a cruel Big Brother game, in which 24 contestants (children age 12-18) kill each other, because live TV has become demanding, and the public loves reality blood and violence. That's it. A little bit of undeveloped and unbelievable romance between her and two boys, a little bit of her abandoned family problems, a little bit of The 5th element movie political structure, mutants and pop stylists. It’s so screwed up.\\n\\nIn the beginning, first 50 pages were well written. There was suspense, Katniss was sweet and witty, but overall this book is a shitty meltdown. Adding the ridiculous cliffhanger ending. Some people here are using words like dystopian literature, and then write essays about how this book is the core of it.\\n\\nThe core is pointlessly graphic and sadistic, without any concrete message except of the negative: this book is just proving that the world today is fucked up if this book is so successful. I don’t see the point of reading about the fictional kids who are doing this to each other.\\n\\nIn a metaphorical way it is promoting political establishments of certain countries and that is getting tiring. Not all people are eager to swallow the shit of general brainwashing. Katniss being the heroine (ironical quote marks). Being loyal and darling and a role model. Just wake up. Life is happening and some pretty dark things are happening while you are thinking that Katniss is the representative of the club called liberation.\\n\\nFor me, in a bookish way it stands for one bad one night stand, kiss and forget. But as always, readers tend to bring fiction to their real life and just as many think that kittens and superheroes are comfort zones, a lot of readers perceive this plot as their own little shrine.\\n\\nBut that is me not being in tune with the mainstream population which is too distracted with billboards.\\n\\nBecause it is easier, because why protest, why not simply take what you are given - eat your GMO Monsanto's company hamburgers, eat your cancer giving Nestle products and think that The Hunger Games are the best franchise ever, like ever. If you don't have any arguments about real life activism and if you think that there is deepness in this plot which I have yet not seen so you need to enlightened me, just include North Korea or Hitler or ISIS(L) or those poor people who are closed in Zara hangers who work nonstop ''somewhere'' in the world because obviously you are aware of the crisis although you don’t think you could show on the map but you have heard somewhere on Murdoch media.\\n\\nThis shit sells. It's genuinely bad but excellently targeted. You know, it evokes pride and loyalty and massacring children, freedom and scandal and Hollywood. It goes very well with all the Kardashian filth. As long as it sells, sells, sells. And marketing agencies know that people are united when they are jealous, when they want and they with those hamburgers want freedom. Nobody is going to kill their Katniss in a goddam book! Really? Take a look around you.\\n\\nAnd then the punch line for this book comes from the so called activism from the shopping mall. People who devour literature of this kind and think that everything is all right while in the same time, fuck, you are getting oozingly fat.\\n\\nBottom line.\\n\\nThis book is very shallow and MTV culture oriented, like a classical example of easy consummated pop-literature; I'm very surprised that it didn't come with some trash magazine subscription. If it doesn't have savage brutality, prize money and prefix ''media coverage'' then it won't be appealing and educational because surely this is how children of 21st century survive this techno media world; through examples of true moral issues and realistic outcomes. Have another gulp of Coca-Cola along the way while you listen to dubstep shit.\\n\\nIt saddens me when a violent hillbillish book is so popular. What is there to truly identify yourself with. Except if your chicken soup for soul are basic emotions which come with buy 1 get 1 free.\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'Hello, I am back again with another breakdown review while I relearn how to write reviews. But basically the TL;DR of this review is that The Hunger Games truly holds up so well in 2020, and this reread was such a treat. I felt such nostalgia, happiness, and hope between these pages, and I already can’t wait to revisit this story again. Also, again, this review will have , so use caution if you don’t want me to tell you what happens in each chapter of this book!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis first chapter really starts off with a heartbreaking bang. We quickly learn so many characters, but we even more quickly learn what type of character Katniss Everdeen is. The basic premise of this tale is that there are twelve districts and once a year each district will select two young candidates to fight to the death in a game, which will also be broadcasted for the world to see. Every year, a teenagers name gets added once to this random selection pool, but each year they get older another time their name gets added. Also, you can add your name more times to get food and supplies for your family, and this is very much the norm for most children. Katniss’s sister, Prim, only has her name in the drawing once because it is her first time, where Katniss has her name added over twenty times. Yet, you see where this is going…\\n\\n\\nOnce Prim’s name is pulled, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place in the games. Meanwhile, the boy contestant is Peeta Mellark, who Katniss remembers giving her bread when her family was starving after the death of their father. Together, they are thrown into a competition that no one believes they will be able to come back alive. Especially since only one victor is allowed, therefore one of them will most certainly have to die.\\n\\n\\nKatniss is given her iconic mockingjay pin that will literally change the world as she knows it.\\n\\n\\nHaymitch punches Peeta to make him look rougher, lol. The journey Haymitch is about to take alongside these two kids as their mentor, whew.\\n\\n\\nCinna (my favorite character), makes Katniss a fire dress in which the world has never seen, and will be the first time the world finds it extremely hard to forget her or her name. Also, unknown to Katniss, a start of a public romance is brewing with Peeta to help their image. We also get to meet President Snow and start to get a vibe of all the evil things he has been stirring up for some time now.\\n\\n\\nKatniss and Peeta make it to the training center and they start to learn about the other candidates from the other districts. We also get to learn about the different privileges of the other districts, and how some of these candidates view this as an honor to volunteer their life for (without needing to save a little sister). We also get to see Rue, and it’s really hard to not feel like you want to reach into the pages and protect her yourself.\\n\\n\\nKatniss makes quite the impression with an arrow and an apple, that many important people of the Capitol find very hard to ignore.\\n\\n\\nThis is the start of the Peeta versus Gale debate, and the brewing of a very opinionated love-triangle. For me, personally, I always think it’s obvious in Katniss’s inner monologue that she only likes Peeta, but I digress.\\n\\n\\nWe get to meet Caesar Flickerman and see Katniss and Peeta’s vastly different interviews with him. Peeta is coached to very much play the star-crossed lovers card, and he even tells Caesar that he loves Katniss more than anything.\\n\\n\\nThis is the start of Part 2, where they games are finally going to begin. And Cinna says my favorite line in the entire series to Katniss. So simple, so beautiful, so heartbreaking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe twenty-four tributes are entering the game, and in the middle is a cornucopia filled with weapons and supplies… if you are brave enough to make a run for them. Peeta distracts her at the very start of the game, so Katniss doesn’t go for the bow. And we quickly see that people are starting to form groups to take out some of the weaker players.\\n\\n\\nKatniss is proving that she will do whatever it takes to survive.\\n\\n\\nKatniss is still up in a tree, surviving, when she sees Rue and they form a silent plan together.\\n\\n\\nShe does get the medicine she needs from someone out there watching her in the world, who is rooting for her and her life. After with the help of some killer, engineered wasps… she is able to get down from this tree and gets a bow.\\n\\n\\nKatniss teams up with Rue, while they come up with a big plan to make it a little harder for the districts teaming up with all the supplies.\\n\\n\\nYeah, Katniss blows up the whole cornucopia.\\n\\n\\nYet, while Katniss and Rue are trying to meet up again with their mockingjay signals, Rue gets killed by a spear. Katniss sings to her, and realizes that nothing will be the same in her life again, no matter how long she has left.\\n\\n\\nKatniss is trying to deal with the hurt and pain and loss as best as she can, but she also is very hard of hearing in one of her ears now. And she also knows that Peeta has been wounded and is missing.\\n\\n\\nBut beyond all else, Katniss is a tracker and a hunter, and she quickly looks for Peeta at a water source and finds him. They also share a kiss when they find shelter, and she vows that she is not going to let him die.\\n\\n\\nThis chapter has some beautiful foreshadowing of giving Peeta some berries.\\n\\n\\nBasically, at this point, each contestant needs a certain supply very badly, so they place the things they need back in the middle of the map, and Katniss goes to retrieve theirs. She does get very injured in the process but makes it back to heal him. Thresh helped Katniss because of what she did for Rue.\\n\\n\\nPeeta takes care of Katniss and they get more care-packages because they are now the Capitol’s OTP and everyone is rooting for them and their romance.\\n\\n\\nThresh dies, and it breaks my heart every time because I highkey always root for him too. District 11 just deserved better. Cato is still alive, still the biggest threat, and still hella annoying. And then we have some more berry foreshadowing when a girl dies eating some.\\n\\n\\nNow that there are only three people left (Katniss, Peeta, and Cato) the game makers want them to finally put an end to the 74th Hunger Games once and for all. Kato runs at them, while wolves start running after them.\\n\\n\\nAnd we quickly find out that the wolves are none other than the people who died in the games. Well, I think at least. They for sure have the tributes eyes, and it just makes it extra freaky. But basically, after some fighting and some monologues, Kato is dying to the wolves slowly, but Katniss puts him out of his misery. They were promised earlier that if Katniss and Peeta were the final two of the game that they could both win and live, but now the game makers are trying to change that game right before them. And since they are saying there can only be one victor, Katniss takes a risk with those beloved berries and her an Peeta threaten suicide before all the people watching from the comfort of their own homes.\\n\\n\\nBut because they need a winner, they decide two is better than none, so they both are able to live. Katniss wakes up in a hospital where her body is healing and she is able to hear out of her one ear again. She gets to see Cinna, and believe that maybe their lives will be normal again. But Katniss quickly realizes that the Capitol is terribly upset that she played with them, and they are not going to ignore her actions in the game.\\n\\n\\nKatniss gets to see Peeta again, and they are forced to watch all the deaths that happened in the game during their winner’s interview. They both have taken so much damage physically and mentally, and they know that Snow is not through hurting them, or the people they love, by a longshot.\\n\\n| | | | |\\n\\nfor loss of a parent, animal death(s), abandonment, depression, PTSD depiction, blood depiction, alcoholism, gore, violence, and murder.\\n\\nBuddy read with & ! ❤'},\n",

       "    'review': 'I read this when it was first published, ordering it before I knew it was YA, and years before any films (which I\\'ve not seen). If I were a teenager or recommending this to a teen, I might give it 3*; as an adult, I give it 2*.\\n\\nPLOT\\n\\nIt\\'s a potentially exciting but gruesome story, but most of the characters were rather flat, and much of the plot was predictable, partly because it\\'s not hugely original. See Shirley Jackson\\'s , which I reviewed , and the Japanese . Furthermore, there were too many flaws in the plot. I fail to understand its very high ratings.\\n\\nPost-apocalyptic America (Panem) is divided into a wealthy and technologically advanced Capitol and twelve subsidiary districts of oppressed people who exist in dire poverty, with inadequate food, housing, and health care and hardly any technology. To reinforce the power of the Capitol by instilling fear in the population, once a year, two children from each region are selected by lots to fight to the death in a reality show. If that were not bad enough, the whole thing is utterly corrupt in multiple ways, plus the public bet on the outcome, and sponsors can sway the results. Did I mention these are ? (Some are as young as 12, though the narrator is 16.) A compulsory full-body wax on a teen seems rather pervy and who would want to bet on, let alone sponsor a child-killing tournament, even if it\\'s by helping one of the contestants? As the book keeps reminding readers, one person\\'s survival is only possible by the death of the others.\\n\\nCRUELTY TO CHILDREN\\n\\nI realise that horrendous things are done to children around the world every day (extreme poverty, child soldiers, sexual assault, genital mutilation etc), but in none of those cases is the that but one child dies, and nor is it organised by the for a sick combination of sport, entertainment, punishment and profit.\\n\\nHumans often lack compassion, but I was never convinced by Collins\\' world - especially the fact this outrage has continued for (it\\'s the 74th games), apparently without the Capitol even needing to invoke gods or supernatural powers to justify their cruelty! Could a barbaric annual tournament really be such a powerful incentive not to rise up in all that time? (I don\\'t think so.)\\n\\nBIG ISSUES\\n\\nNevertheless, it tackles some big themes that are particularly pertinent to teens: the nature of friendship; divided loyalties; the difference between love and friendship; who to trust; whether the ends justify the means; the need to repay favours; the danger of power, wealth and celebrity; the corrupting influence of reality TV; the need for independence, and whether you can trust a parent who abandons you.\\n\\nIt all feels rather laboured to me, but it might not if I were a teen, which only reinforces my puzzlement at the number of adults who have enjoyed it. I must be missing something.\\n\\nNARRATIVE STRUCTURE\\n\\nNearly half the book is backstory and preparation for the games; the remainder is a tale of hunter and hunted. I predicted the main plot twist less than a quarter of the way in (and the fact that Katniss is telling the story limits the possible outcomes), but the suspense was broken when it was made explicit way before the end. There are some other twists between then and the final page, but by then I was rather annoyed with the whole thing.\\n\\nIMPLAUSIBILITY AND INCONSISTENCIES\\n\\nI\\'d enjoyed the book more, I would have found it easier to suspend my disbelief, but as it was, I was constantly irked by questions and inconsistencies.\\n\\n* The contestants (and their parents and grandparents) have been forced to watch the games every year of their lives. I suppose they had become inured to it, but on the other hand, that meant they the horror of it. I just didn\\'t believe there was as little fear in them as there appeared to be - given that they are children.\\n* Participants don\\'t want other participants to know where they are, yet sponsor gifts occasionally drop out of the sky, via silver parachute; not a risk, apparently.\\n* It\\'s all filmed by numerous invisible floating cameras (I can buy that), but that somehow includes filming inside a cave that is virtually sealed (I can\\'t).\\n* How (and why) would any of these participants be able to measure time to within half hour intervals?\\n* How big is Panem? It can only be a tiny part of the USA because each district specialises in only one thing (coal mining, agriculture etc) and has just one town square that can accommodate everyone (8,000 people in District 12) and yet it\\'s a day\\'s train journey from District 12 to the Capitol. It doesn\\'t seem like a very plausible settlement pattern in a post-disaster world, even given the totalitarian regime (concentrating people in a few centres makes it easier to observe and perhaps control them, but it also creates more opportunities for opposition movements to develop).\\n\\nCOMPARED WITH LORD OF THE FLIES\\n\\nThere are some similarities with \"Lord of the Flies\" (my review here: ), but although \"The Hunger Games\" is likely to have more appeal to modern teens, I think there are (at least) two crucial differences:\\n\\n* In LotF one person\\'s survival is not necessarily at the cost of everyone else\\'s. (It is even possible that they could all survive.)\\n\\n* LotF has much more depth and symbolism: it tackles original sin; the mystical \"Beast\"; leadership, tribal allegiance and group dynamics (including bullying and attitudes to difference and minor disability) and the importance of ritual and belief.\\n\\nThe second point is what makes LotF a better book, in my opinion.\\n\\nOf course, there are other, more obvious, parallels with extreme \"reality\" shows such as \"Survivor\" and \"I\\'m a Celebrity, get me out of here\", but the fundamental differences are not just that contestants in those shows do not fear for their lives, but that they are adults who have to enter.\\n\\nI TRIED TO ENJOY IT!\\n\\nAny fans who read this will now hate me. I wanted to enjoy this book, and I read it all the way through, making notes as usual, but to no avail. Sorry.'},\n",

And may the odds be ever in your favor.”\\n\\n\\nis it crazy to say that this is my first time experiencing this universe? i personally feel like it is. i’m terribly late to the party. it seems like everyone has read the books and/or watched the movies and i’m the only person on the face of earth who didn’t have this phase. i was just a kid a decade ago and i don’t remember much, but i do recall seeing the way people were obsessed with when the movies came out. everyone was going crazy about it — but me? well, frankly, i was not interested in it and i’ve never felt the urge to watch the movies or read the books. it was just not my thing back then, and now i regret that because i bet it was so fun to be a fan at that time.\\n\\nbut hey, after a decade (more than that, actually) i’m finally here! you know what they say... better late than never. now enough with the small talk; let’s get into it, shall we?\\n\\nso... everyone knows what it is about (even me, who haven’t read the books or watched the movies) but i must say that the premise of the games where 23 teenagers aged 12-18 are forced to fight to the death and only one of them can survive is intriguing and obviously insane (irrelevant, but i’m a hundred percent sure that i would be the first one to die if i were there, there’s no chance i could survive). and the fact that it’s a televised event? what the hell... the whole thing is absolutely vile when you stop to think about it. but even though it’s brutal, and also sort of predictable in a few aspects, it’s undeniable that it’s entertaining to read.\\n\\ni’m not fond of dystopian novels. in fact, this was my first one, so i didn’t know what to expect and i was a bit hesitant that i wouldn’t like it. thankfully, turns out i ended up liking it and finding it interesting. although i have to admit that i was kind of confused with some stuff (i’m not kidding when i say that not even 20 pages in i was already lost) but i was honestly expecting that since it was my introduction to a new genre.\\n\\nit took me awhile to get into the story given the fact that it was slow at the beginning, but i got hooked once the pace picked up and i started growing attached to the main characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni believe we can all agree that is a badass. i mean, how could we not? such an icon. i must say that i adore reading books with female main characters like her.\\n\\nanother admirable thing about her is that she’s willing to do whatever it takes to protect and make sacrifices for the people she loves — especially her younger sister, Prim. given her father’s death and her mother’s depression Katniss had to take on the role of protector for her sister and, on top of that, she had to be the provider for their family. not the responsabilities someone from her age should be having of course, which is undeniably sad, but i admire how strong and selfless she is above all. if it wasn’t for her selflessness, she wouldn’t even be part of the 74th Hunger Games; Prim was the one who was chosen during the reaping, but Katniss decided to sacrifice herself and take her place because she couldn’t bear the thought of her little sister facing the cruelty of these games.\\n\\nKatniss is not perfect, she’s a flawed character who can be annoying at times, but given the circumstances, we can totally understand why she acted the way she did and i don’t think we should be too harsh on her. and besides, she’s a teenager who’s just trying to survive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnow, about ... see, i’ve always seen people saying he’s perfect and that he’s the ultimate boyfriend, but i was like “” but oh silly me, how i was wrong! you guys weren’t exaggerating, he deserves all the hype he gets. what’s not to love about him? he’s so kind, sweet, thoughtful, funny and easily loveable. i have a thing for MMCs who are cinnamon rolls so it’s not much of a surprise that i fell for him. i wish we got more of his personality, though. i didn’t feel like he was a well-explored character in certain aspects. either way, i liked him and i’m glad that meeting him was not a disappointing experience.\\n\\nbut, generally speaking, i don’t think the romance was exactly what i wanted. sure, it was good, but not awesome, you know? and i can’t say i am super obsessed with their relationship; not as much as i wanted to, at least. don’t get me wrong, i did love their dynamic and if you check out my updates you’ll see me fangirling over them, the thing is that i just felt like something was missing overall and i was also expecting much more. probably because of all the hype surrounding them. though i think that in some way i can understand the reasons behind that — romance isn’t really the most important thing here, is it? and besides, this is the first book, and i have two more books to read so i believe (and hope) that Suzanne will develop their relationship more and surely my feelings will be a little different by then. all that being said, are cute and that’s something i’ll never deny.\\n\\nand since we are on this topic, i need to ask an important question: where is the love triangle? i’m very confused, guys. the chemistry between Katniss & Gale was nowhere to be found here and, at least so far, i don’t understand at all why people like and choose Gale. he’s kind of bland, sorry. but well... let’s see what happens next, maybe it’s too early to make assumptions. whatever happens, though, i won’t switch teams. and i’m sure about that. what can i say? won me over.\\n\\nanyways, moving on... as you might have noticed, i mentioned a few complaints throughout this review and there are other things that prevented me from giving it a high rating.\\n\\nfirst of all, this didn’t meet all of my expectations. it was a great book and i did like it, but i had over the top expectations and, unfortunately, some of them weren’t met. i was expecting to finish this book and be like “” but that’s not quite what happened.\\n\\nalthough this book was enjoyable for the most part, there were lots of parts that were monotonous to me and there were also some things that i would change if i had the chance.\\n\\ni started losing a bit of interest in the last couple chapters. i can’t pinpoint why, though. i was just not having much fun anymore and that was one of the main reasons why i couldn’t rate this story higher.\\n\\nthe ending was not precisely what i wanted. i was expecting something satisfying and perhaps more intense, but that’s not what i got. i was disappointed.\\n\\nbut keeping all my complaints aside, . it offers a relevant, interesting and well-written story with remarkable characters that are easily captivating, so of course i think everyone should read it at least once. if you haven’t read it yet, what are you waiting for? go for it.\\n\\ni will continue the series and i’m extremely excited to do so! i literally can’t wait to see what the next book will bring — hopefully something better that will exceed my expectations. now, please excuse me while i go watch the first film. 🏃🏼\\u200d♀️\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n─────────────────────\\n\\n\\n\\ni know i’m super late to the party, but i’ve finally decided to start this series and i can’t even express how excited i am! let’s see if it’ll live up to my expectations. 👀'},\n",

       "    'review': 'For a long time now, I’ve wanted to rewrite my review of The Hunger Games so that I could tell you why I don’t just love this series, but why I also think it’s important. It is beautiful for the unflinching way it shows you, as a reader, your own willingness to disregard people who are different from you - how you are the Capitol audience. But, it is important as a story about girls. I had not initially thought about articulating that point because it seemed so obvious to me, and I am bad at recognizing my own assumptions. Lately, though, I have seen so many people, both men and women, acting as though this remarkable book is a piece of fluff that I realized maybe what I love most about is not as obvious as it seems. To me, this series is important because it is a landmark departure from the traditional story about girls.\\n\\nToo often, stories objectify women. But the word “objectify,” I’ve realized, has almost no meaning for someone who has either not experienced objectification or who hasn’t really recognized it in her own life, so I’m going to be more descriptive here. When I say stories objectify girls, I mean they that sometimes have handy dandy extra gadgets such as an and .\\n\\nSidebar: if you are inclined to now google the word \"fleshlight,\" I encourage you to consult the before doing that, as the google results will probably be NSFW and also NSF those of you whose parents might check your browsing history. Do parents know how to do that? Sorry for the sidebar, I am just intending to make an explicit point, and now I am feeling uncomfortable about what that explicit point might mean to the target audience of this book. Girls, you are probably badass like Katniss, and you are definitely a fleshlight.\\n\\nBack to my rant about typical objectification in storytelling: often the fleshlights have . Sometimes they have , and other times they work as for or or . A lot of times, I will hear people refer to this type of objectification as treating women like they are just a vagina, or a pair of boobs, but I think there is something to the stories that is less human and more sexbot machine than that complaint covers.\\n\\nSo, in all of those links, I have tried to include books written by men and by women because I think that women think of ourselves this way almost as often as men think of us this way. The link from , for example, shows both a man and a woman treating women like fleshlights. I have also included both books I love and books I hate because, ultimately, I do think girls adopt this story about themselves, and I also think we can pretty easily identify with a male protagonist and disregard female characters who look nothing like humans. For example, is one of my favorite books in the whole world, even though it does not contain any women who resonate with my experience of humans. And I don\\'t think it\\'s necessarily bad that I can enjoy stories where women are only fleshlights, as long as I can still be whoever I want to be without a positive role model. I think it\\'s good to enjoy stories and take what we can get from them, and so I don\\'t regret that I love .\\n\\nIn seeing some male reactions to , I am reminded that most men do not identify with female protagonists the way women have been trained to identify with male protagonists. This seems like a huge disadvantage for men to be in, to me, and if you are a man reading this review, I would ask you to check out your bookshelves. How many female authors are on your shelves? How many of the books those authors wrote have no central male character? If you have a minute after that, check the shelves of a woman you are friends with and see how many of her books were written by men or have no central female character. Odds are the results will be pretty different.\\n\\nis such a groundbreaking and deliberate example of a woman’s perspective on war and family and even men that it floors me. I think it partly floors me because, other than , I can’t think of another example of a female character who really fights for herself in such an obvious and hopeful way. Katniss is strong and broken, and powerful in her brokenness. Collins’s image of a woman’s perspective is not, admittedly, as effortless as Moira Young’s in , but its deliberateness has its own value.\\n\\nIt is not an accident that the story shows Katniss’s emotional growth and that Peeta, as a more emotionally whole person, facilitates her emotional growth. It is not an accident that the story does not discuss the effect Katniss has on the erectness of Peeta’s and Gale’s penises. The first is not an accident because in reality, men do not have to be the emotional cowards that the stories I’ve linked to above make them out to be. Masculinity does not have to mean emotional cowardice. The second is not an accident because the story is not from Peeta and Gale’s perspectives. Despite widespread rumors to the contrary, it is my experience that women pretty seldom think about their effect on men’s penises. Hopefully, we think of our primary purpose in life, in the way so many stories think of it, as making penises erect. Hopefully, we never think of ourselves as gadgets that are super fun for other people.\\n\\nThere are so many reasons I love series, and all of this is one I wouldn’t have initially even thought to say. I saw this Eleanor Roosevelt quote earlier this month, and it said, “It is better to light one small candle than to curse the darkness.” I think is a candle in the overall dark narrative of girls’ perspective on life. Yes, it is also a poignant critique of reality TV and Western callousness about the catastrophes caused by industrialization in the developing world, but that, too, resonates with me in many ways because of its remarkably feminine voice. It absolutely makes sense to me that this book is not for everyone because of its violence, but I still think that it is objectively important because it shows a perspective that seems authentically feminine to me – that talks like a girl, not like a sexy, fancy gadget. I’m not saying that in my opinion girls don’t or shouldn’t ever think about being sexy or erect penises, I’m just saying that it is my experience that we think and care about many, many more things than penises, clean houses, and food, and very, very few stories are willing to tell you about that. The is one that does, and it does so in way that is beautiful and important.'},\n",

       "    'review': \"It seems weird that I never reviewed The Hunger Games . I don't know why I didn't when it was a series that completely took over my life for a short while. But recently I've been thinking about posting something in this review space and after just watching the second film (which I think was amazing and better than the first), now seems like as good a time as any to talk about why I love Katniss and nearly everything about this series.\\n\\nI gave this book four stars back in 2011 and I'm going to leave that rating as it is because it's an indicator of my thoughts at the time (though they slightly differ now) - thoughts which were influenced by having just finished the fantastic, horrifying, brutal and unforgettable manga series. I don't think it was the best time for myself and Katniss to find one another when I had so much beautiful insanity to compare the book to, but it still managed to have such an effect on me that I instantly told every friend and family member to read it. Coming back to this now after having spent the last couple of years being bombarded with dystopian YA, I appreciate what Collins has achieved a whole lot more.\\n\\nI appreciate the strength of Katniss as a heroine who commands our attention and holds our love whilst still being what some would consider unlikable; I appreciate the balance of beauty and horror that Collins delivers on every page, treating us constantly to both the darkest despair and rays of hope; and I also - amazingly - appreciate the love triangle. Love triangles seem to have chased me and hunted me down with every YA read I picked up over the last two or three years - my dislike for romance instantly becoming doubled by the introduction of yet another boy with beautiful eyes. But Katniss, Peeta and Gale worked for me. They convinced me, held my interest and made me cry. The love triangle worked because it's outcome wasn't obvious, because we all wondered and hoped and worried.\\n\\nKatniss still remains for me everything that a female protagonist should be. Or a female hero, at least. She fights for the ones she loves, she's brave and doesn't need to be saved. But neither is she a one-dimensional smiling poster-version of a heroine. She falls, she fails, people get hurt because of her and she has to live with that. We love her and yet she's antisocial, awkward and moody. She loves other people with all her heart but she's not much of a team player. In short: she's a complex portrait of a young woman that doesn't fall into any neatly defined boxes or categories. Now, perhaps, authors have since tried to recreate her. But she's still one of the first and best.\\n\\nI know another review of this book isn't needed. I know you've all probably read it anyway. Or never will. But this isn't really for anyone else; it's a reminder to myself of why this book deserves its hype and why I need to remember to come back to it again and again between the new (and hopefully amazing) YA books I'll be reading in the future.\"},\n",

I’ve already seen the movie, but the book is so much better.\\n\\nIn The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is scraping by, just trying to make her daily living, hunting by her bow in the forest to feed her family. Every year, The Capitol requires every district to offer up one boy and one girl as tributes. The tributes fight each other to the death until only one person survives. This fight is called The Hunger Games.\\n\\nThe day of the Reaping finally comes. This is the day where the one boy and one girl are selected. Unfortunately, Prim, Katniss’s younger sister is selected. In an incredible act of bravery, Katniss volunteers to take her sister’s place. Will Katniss make it through The Hunger Games?\\n\\nFirst of all, the narrator on this was perfect. She even did the accent for the Capitol people, and she sang the song.\\n\\nSecond, The Hunger Games is a perfect dystopian novel. It has different dresses and customs, but it isn’t overkill or confusing.\\n\\nThere are also many parallels to today’s society. For example, why do the citizens allow The Hunger Games? Because they don’t believe that their children will be selected. How many people believe that they will never be unemployed, never get divorced, never become seriously ill or injured? People like betting on themselves. But we, as a society, aren’t we better off if we made sure that there were strong safety nets in place for those who happen on hard times?\\n\\nIn The Hunger Games, all is also not equal. The tributes can have sponsors who rain down much needed supplies on the tributes. We like to think that everyone has an equal opportunity. But is that really the case when the rich can purchase private ACT/SAT tutors for their children? What about those who start their first job and have strong allies and mentors from day one?\\n\\nBut I also loved this book, because it had many small acts of kindness.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith cruelty becoming commonplace, kindness stands out. When District 11 came together, I racked my brain trying to remember the last time that we, as a society, came together for a cause, and I came up short. I think the world is hungry for a rallying cry, a cause that we can all fight together for. What would the world be like if the cruelty was replaced by kindness?

She is so strong and bad-ass but she always misunderstands Peeta! It\\'s so obvious that he loves her but she is in denial! She is so stupid!! And when she realizes his feelings, she just hurt him! Congrats!\\n\\n\\n4 stars because of Katniss\\' stupidity!\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s start from the beginning!\\n\\nWhat is Hunger Games?\\nEvery year, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 were selected from each of the twelve districts as tributes, who train for a week and then are sent into an arena to fight to the death.Only one tribute can win the games. This competition is showed to television to be seen by all citizens.\\n\\nSo, Katniss\\' little sister, Prim, is selected for the games, but Katniss took her place to save her.\\n\\nThe boy who was chosen to participate was Peeta Mellark, a boy who Katniss knew because she saved her from starvation and give her some bread as a result his mother beat him!\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n1) I loved Peeta! He protected her but I will admit she protected him as well! She risked her life to get the medicine needed to heal his leg. But how can she not see that he is madly in love with her? I loved it when he told her about her singing for the music class, that\\'s when Peeta realized he was in love with her when he saw that the birds were listening like they did for her father.\\n\\n\\n\\n2)I think she has feelings for him deep down! Very deep.\\n\\nSometimes when she kissed Peeta she felt guilty because of Gale! Why????He is her best friend! At the beginning, she said that she never saw him that way and now what? She is confusing me.\\nPlease, not love triangle again!!I liked Gale but no!\\n\\n\\n3)Curiously, I liked Haymitch! He won the Hunger Games of his time. He is also Katniss\\' and Peeta\\'s mentor. It seems at first that he doesn\\'t like Katniss very much but at the Hunger Games he helped her more than he helped Peeta.\\n\\n\\n\\n4)I also liked Cinna, their stylist. He always supported her in his way.\\n\\n\\n5)Rue! She was the 12-year-old female tribute from District 11. I really liked that Katniss allied with Rue. They were amazing together. But Rue died.\\n\\nI understand only one can win( our case two) but I felt so sad when she died. Not only her though. A lot innocent kids die because of the Capitol. It\\'s not fair.\\n\\n\\n6)In the half of the games, it was announced that two tributes from the same district can win. So katniss and Peeta can be allies. But when all the other tributes died it was announced that the rule they said early has been canceled. I was so angry! They did it on purpose. Assholes!!!\\n\\n\\n7)When they announced it, Katniss aimed her bow at Peeta when she sees he has picked up a weapon, but he throw it into the lake. She is so stupid. He didn\\'t want to fight her and she thought that he could kill her.\\n\\n\\n8)I was scared when Peeta and Katniss threaten to commit double suicide so there will be no winner! But it was a trick. Thankfully, that trick worked and both PEETA AND KATNISS WERE WINNERS!\\n\\n\\n9)And the ending! Peeta discovers that Katniss was mostly acting during the games about the feelings. He was so heartbroken! My baby!\\n\\n\\n\\nP.S. I haven\\'t seen the movie yet!'},\n",

       "    'review': \"In around 100 A.D., Roman poet Juvenal wrote that ‘everything now restrains itself and anxiously hopes for just two things: bread and circuses.’ How true and terrifying these words are to remain relevant through the ages and how succinctly they get to the heart of Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games. Published in 2008, this novel introduced the world to its harrowing heroine, Katniss Everdeen, whom Collin’s has describes as ‘’ volunteering herself to be sent in sacrifice for the entertainment of others in order to protect her sister and taking not only it’s fiction world of Panem by storm but the real world as well. The novel launched into a trilogy and subsequent prequels with the newest slated to arrive next year, has been translated into 56 languages and by the time the first film adaptation arrived in 2012 it had already sold nearly 18 million copies. Yet somehow I have never managed to read the books until now despite rather enjoying the films though after some prodding by my daughter I have finally entered Collins arena and I have to admit…this was incredible. This book practically launched a decade of dystopian novels as popular fiction and helped bring the YA genre to prominence, though I wouldn’t even say this is a teen novel but a novel simply anyone could enjoy across the spectrum of ages. Perfectly plotted for maximum tension and intrigue and quite brilliantly written, this is practically impossible to put down as it brings hit after hit of action, terror and sharp social criticism. A novel of an obdurate authoritarian government and wealthy class upholding power through propaganda, division, lack of resources and public displays of violence, shows the ripples of unrest begun through the actions of a bold heroine with ‘’ to break through the public control of Juvenal’s ‘’ May the odds be ever in her favor.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nAt this point the story to is practically common knowledge and culturally embedded the way one need not give a description of what, say, or is about. Collins perfectly amalgamates narratives explored in stories such as or with early 2000s channel surfing and rise of reality television into a violent, dystopian world. I’ve always said marketing is simply the marketable term for propaganda and takes this to an extreme level. Their futuristic gladiator-esque battles pitting children from each District of Panem in a brutal contest of survival becomes a sort of reality-television yearly event that keeps the districts in line reminding them of the cost of rebellion while also keeping them at odds with one another, broadcasted as entertainment in such a way as to make one think of ’s warning that ‘’ The Game’s have a sinister marketing mechanism to them, the ‘’ half of Juvenal’s prophetic words.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nPlucked from their impoverished conditions and brought to the Capitol and put on display for people to pick favorites and become sponsors for (not unlike politicians begging for donations and trying to get corporations to fund them since in the US a person is capped at around $3k in donations but corporations can give endless money), not for the sake of humanizing them but, more insidiously, to give the impression of humanizing them while actually making them into a . The sort of character you can become attached to without having to feel any authentic sadness over their death, the type of character you can enjoy from afar without having to confront the reality of their mortality and personhood. ‘’ Katniss has to grapple with, ‘’ Which hits hard in the age of algorithms and brands pretending to be people on social media, but in the Games it means if the children aren���t murdering each other sensationally enough they’ll send a fireball at Katniss so the slogan “the girl who was on fire” gets a little more traction to sell sponsorships. Little did they realize that very slogan could take on a double meaning of resistance…\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nPerhaps this is from having seen the whole arc before reading the book but this read was a fascinating exercise in well-plotted foreshadowing with Katniss as a fairly unreliable narrator that has yet to become aware that her character building has been subverted as one of rebellion. Madge, the mayor’s daughter, giving her the Mockingjay pin is just the start of her transformation into a symbol and the slow-burn of scripted romance and showmanship is all aimed at showing ‘’ As my daughter pointed out, Panem is a total surveillance State and the randomness of the Games lottery—something that feels vaguely akin to 's (read in link)—is likely more marketing than actuality the way reality TV vet’s their contestants and the Capitol is far too horny for control to not hand-pick contestants for maximum profitablility under the fake guise of chance. The District 12 handlers have also had time to devise a quiet plan and use the flow of entertainment as a way to enact it as long as it is keeping ratings high and the public glued to there television. This, like all marketing (I have a degree in this almost entirely for the purpose of shit talking it), is best done by appealing to emotions (fear and religion, the latter of which is absent in Panem, being the two with strongest resonance) and employing psychological manipulation to make viewers/customers/etc feel they are making their own choices instead of being corralled, and by creating the character of Katniss they are playing into the marketing needs of the Capitol and the entertainment factors of The Games while also planting their own seeds of subversion in the highly fertile soils of public option. Here is where Juvenal’s ‘bread’ comes in.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nCollins pays special attention to food throughout the novel with bread having a very symbolic purpose. [] more like the HANGRY Games, am I right!? **elbows you in the ribs until you are assured therapy is in your future** Katniss’ own name and her father’s quip that ‘’ is key here too, as she becomes the symbol that gives hope in districts that are quite literally being starved while we see the juxtaposition of the Capitol’s wealth mainly portrayed through their absurd and frivolous fashion and lavish meals. Compared to the Districts, ‘’ when being fed and entertained is part and parcel of their access to wealth while being constantly reminded that those outside the Capitol are famished and those who betray them become an Avox with their tongues cut out serving out in the public eye so all can see and internalize the punishment. The public shows of violence are part of the way the Capitol keeps the masses down, coupled with their refusal to let the Districts communicate, dividing them and only allowing them to interact as rivals during The Games. As Juvenal said, control oomes from the circus—not unlike the way ’s was a world that, under the systematic drugging and entertaining by the State, controlled itself in order to avoid pain—but also bread and keeping a population starving in order to feed them as a reward is a fast way to ensure they line up and keep their heads down in order to receive the “good graces” of the State and look out for themselves to avoid punishment only further dividing them. Make life a “every person for themselves” situation and punish anyone in proximity to any crime and people will not unite. It is a union busting tactic and a reminder that family is on the line if you step out of line. When Katniss shoots an arrow at the onlookers out of frustration she is less scared for herself than what they might do to her family as punishment.\\n\\nThis isn’t just in dystopia either and there are a lot of real world examples in the US of this sort of thing. Look at the in Michigan’s Upper Penninsula, my own state, where management shouted “fire” in a hall being used for an employee christmas party to trigger a panicked stampede to punish workers for collective action—59 of the 73 people killed were children, the youngest being 2 years old—to send a message that uniting against the powers that be meant death of your family. Or, even more insidious, simple glossing over violence by distracting with gestures that seem positive but cede no power. Llook at how the was a way to put a good government marketing spin on lip service to the working class without any actual action in response to police opening fire and murdering strikers during the in 1894. Such tactics is exactly what the Capitol does, commit violence and then spin it to hold power.\\n\\nThis becomes rather pertinent during the Games when we see how the strong form collective action in order to mop up the weak. It’s like corporations, rallying together and funding politicians to ensure tax reform and policy that benefits them and only betraying each other “in the spirit of competition” once they are the last ones standing. Yet here we see a subversion. Peeta joins with The Careers in order to protect Katniss (trust issues are on high throughout this book) and there are some amazing moments when District 11 realizes they are far more aligned with 12 than the Careers. Its like the sayings on class solidarity people like to posture but rarely enact about how the middle class is far more aligned with the homeless and poor than billionaires but, as the Capitol propagates, all attention is turned towards serving the rich in hopes of being able to survive. I need to give a quick shoutout to District 11 though because they are wholly underrated in the series. Thresh is a real one and my favorite character and Rue is such a little sweetheart who deserved better and Katniss’ realization of this is quite a spark on the fires of rebellion. And how does District 11 thank her? Bread.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nLet’s talk about bread. Bread comes bearing a long history of symbolism. Breaking bread has a connotation of togetherness and unity. We have Jesus in the Bible making five loaves feed the masses, or breaking bread with his apostles as a symbol of unity. And this unity is present here too. Peeta, the sweet little Peeta who is FAR more interesting than the meek version of him in the films, brings Katniss bread when she, like Theseus, volunteers ‘’ to fight in the Games. It is an early symbol of unity replicated by the gift from District 11 after she places flowers on the body of Rue to humanize her death and show that even the deaths of the poor carry emotional weight. It is also a direct fuck you to the showy fashions of the Capitol to adorn the body of the poor with bright colors–bright flowers that will wither and die like the Districts are under their control.\\n\\nUnity becomes key here, and Katniss and Peeta’s collective action to eat the berries becomes the action that allows them to live. It will also become the action that President Snow fears is a spark of rebellion in but I’ve not finished it yet so more on that later. They lived by giving a marketable narrative the Capitol couldn’t spin fast enough. It is interesting to note, however, that the act of rebellion once again involves food and eating. Katniss earlier shoots an arrow through an apple, the apple in the mouth of a pig that fairly represents the way the children being sacrificed for the entertainment of the State, to ensure the Capitol pays attention to her. Even Haymitch’s alcoholism (beer being a product of yeast that nudges the symbol of bread yet again) is a show of indulgence in a world where indulgence is denied to the Districts, can be viewed as a small private rebellion. It also keeps the horrors of his past quieted, not that this condones alcoholism as a coping mechanism but you can see where Collins is going with that. Especially with lines like ‘’ and how we can hold on to our own small personal resistance.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nwas an utterly fantastic book and engaging read far beyond what I had imagined it would be. It is fiery, it is relevant, it is smart, it is a whole lot of fun without sacrificing depth and insight. I liked it a lot better than the movies too, which tend to focus more of the action whereas the book kind of reminded me of the books I read as a kid where it focuses more on the survival aspects. It is a smart little book on the perils and powers of propaganda, the bread and circuses that keep people in line, but also a story about pushing back using their own tactics against them. A fascinating and fantastic book that lives up to the hype.\\n\\n\\n\\n''\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'I LOVE THIS BOOK! I\\'ve said to a few people that if I wasn\\'t married, I\\'d have to marry this book. :) I read the 400 page ARC in a less-than-24-hour time period (so quickly that it was never even on my \"currently reading\" shelf), which I\\'ve only done before with HP books, and I\\'ve just officially put the first book on my 2008 favorites shelf. I feel pretty safe in saying that if this isn\\'t still my favorite book of the year when next January rolls around, that I\\'ll eat a hat. As soon as I finished reading it, I turned around and read it a 2nd time, which I\\'ve never done before in my life. I loved all of Collins\\' GREGOR books, and think she\\'s a wonderful writer, but she\\'s ratcheted it up to another level with this one. Even though it\\'s the first in a trilogy, this one definitely stands alone, and I\\'m not sure how she can keep it up for another 2 books, but I suppose it\\'s possible (think: THE GIVER, although I loved GATHERING BLUE, and liked THE MESSENGER--HUNGER GAMES is much more brutal than THE GIVER, though). It\\'s got some very meaty issues to chew on, not the least of which is reality TV taken to extremes. There\\'s a chaste and unresolved romance (think: TWILIGHT, but I don\\'t think I will make it past the first in that series--HUNGER GAMES has much more action, more of a plot, lots of well-developed secondary characters, as well as extremely likeable main characters. I will miss Katniss until I can read about her again.). What more could you possibly ask for out of a book? It doesn\\'t actually come out until October 2008, but if you can get your hands on an ARC, definitely do! I think that the violence in this will be easier for kids to take, since they probably won\\'t see it quite as clearly as an adult will. None of it is particularly graphic, but it is definitely brutal. This is on the edge of too dark for me, which is my favorite kind of book. There aren\\'t many writers who can push it right to the edge for me without going over (Zusak comes to mind immediately), but Collins is definitely one of them. Another book that I loved, and think of to compare this to is HOUSE OF THE SCORPION, but that fell apart slightly at the end for me. HUNGER GAMES didn\\'t lack anything at all for me. OK, I\\'ll stop gushing. I may have to re-write this review when I get some perspective. (2012: Obviously, I never did rewrite it, and this is my most-\"liked\" review :)\\n\\nMy 10 1/2 yr old son asked to read this with me, so I read it for the 3rd time with him in Oct 2008. Still my definite favorite book of the year, but all the typos in the finished book were pretty disappointing. Still, it\\'s my choice for just about any award out there, come January, including the JHUNT.\\n\\nUpdate May 2009: I am dying because the CATCHING FIRE ARC has just been released, and people are saying it\\'s at least as good at HG. I\\'ve had 2 teenaged boys at my library read this on my recommendation, and both of them came back asking me for more books like it (really there isn\\'t anything). One of them has pre-ordered CATCHING FIRE on Amazon (updated to say that I worked in a fairly disadvantaged neighborhood in DC at the time, so that was not a usual occurrence).\\n\\nMay-June 2011: I\\'m reading this for the 4th time, with my younger son, who\\'s finishing up 5th grade. Still as good as ever!! Can\\'t wait for the movie!!\\n\\nUpdate 2012: Between them, HG and CATCHING FIRE were the pinnacle of my 20-yr career as a YA librarian! I\\'ve seen the movie twice so far, and definitely liked it better the 2nd time, when it didn\\'t have to try to be my favorite book. :)\\n\\nUpdate 2020: It\\'s been 9 years since I last read this, but I\\'ve never listened to the audiobook, so I decided that having it read to me would be a good activity during the covid-19 pandemic. STILL as good as ever, and the odds will forever be in its favor.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'Fantastically Written? Ooooh yeah! Compelling? Yup! Super Quick Read? Most definitely! Original? Um...well *shuffles feet, since I seem to be a rare non-five star-er* not original at all really....\\n\\nMan, I wish someone on my friends list here has also read Battle Royale and this book! The Hunger Games WAS pretty fantastic, hence the four stars (though I would have given 3 1/2 if the choice was available.) I ate it up, shouting into other rooms and offices that I was going to be shoving the book into their hands as soon as I was done, but as it went on desha vu was a little too common for me. I know there are major story types out there, ones that are repeated over and over again. Shakespeare retold 200 different ways. The bible reinterpreted to 2,000,000 varieties of tales....but when it comes to YA dystopia, which is by far my favorite genre of any book, originality is one of my main ways I judge a book. FEED felt utterly original. The world of UGLIES felt new. LITTLE BROTHER was just plain amazing. If it\\'s going to be about \"the future\" we don\\'t know about, make it original. In my mind dystopia novels survive on \"idea\" more than \"excecution\" and while the execution of this was beautiful, the idea was hardly new.\\n\\nWhile I have a really good feeling Collins never read, or maybe even heard of, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games was 90% the plot of Battle Royal, minus the guns, the extra blood, the ability to get to know all the other players. In Battle Royal (short explanation of BR plot: 40 students put on island forced to kill each other and winner is set for life and put on TV etc...), the main focus is a love story between two students trapped in the game, two students bonding together with no real urge to kill others...one of whom had a crush on the other forever and it is only revealed during the game. There are so many other similarities, from the ways the gamemakers manipulate, to the ways the media encourages, to one character having a fever and the other taking care of them with soup. There are even \"career\" battle royal players. In BR you see the emotions before and after someone is killed, their last thoughts, the feeling of the person who killed. It\\'s actually really beautiful the way it is done, and so believable that put in an arena teens WOULD turn into savages. In The Hunger Games, yes the main characters were fantastic, and many of the lesser as well, but Foxface is only Foxface, and the Careers are never more than random 1-dimensional bad guys.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games was very Battle Royale, very The Long Walk (Richard Bachman book), and very much current reality shows. I am not saying it wasn\\'t a GREAT read, I\\'m just saying it shouldn\\'t shake the publishing earth the way I am pretty sure it is going to. I anticipate this is the next Twilight series people are going to gush over. In a few years we\\'ll all be hosting Hunger Games final book parties. I\\'ll be amongst the attendees I\\'m sure.\\n\\nAlso in terms of female main characters, Katiniss may surpass Bella in me wanting to shake sense into a character. Talk about a smart girl being utterly clueless!\\n\\nYes, it was great, but eh, maybe I\\'m just bitter because I think BR is the better book of the two and while Hunger Games will get tons of praise and likely a rather deserved award or two, BR will continue to be banned in many libraries. Amazing what subtracting guns can do to a story. Suddenly it doesn\\'t feel as violent, but rather is more reminiscent of stories we heard growing up. The number of swords and arrow deaths in traditional fairytales is nothing to freak out about, but if bullets are flying, it will give \"too many ideas\" to teens and therefore must be dubbed an adult book.\\n\\nI\\'m pretty sure if I hadn\\'t read BR just a few months back this exeedingly long review would have been just as long only instead of a rant it would have just been one long squeeeeeal of delight over how much I loved the book.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOriginal Comment: Peer pressure, peer pressure, peer pressure. Geez guys! Alright, alright I\\'ll read it!'},\n",

       "    'review': \"spoilers but do y’all remember that scene in book two where all of the victors are being interviewed and keep saying shit that cuts right to the capitol’s bone, all really purposefully overdramatic, and then right after Katniss gets up and that shit with the Dress happens (which she instantly knows is a life sacrifice one of her only friends is making for her) Peeta gets up on that stage and makes a normal speech and then ends it with “I’d be fine, if it weren’t for the baby” like when is literature ever going to reach those peaks of bad bitch energy ever again\\n\\nI think this series is so fascinating in that it basically spurred an entire genre of sort-of-okay YA dystopians and then a lot of really bad YA dystopians, and it gets put a lot into that category. but...\\n\\nThe love triangle being pointless is ; Gale and Peeta are meant to represent the opposite sides of war (something a certain plot point in book three really drives home). Katniss is frankly never romantically interested in either for almost of books one and two; she grows to care about Peeta in the general sense, not just the romantic sense. The eventual romance works for Katniss because it is for her.\\n\\n(What I’m saying is this was tenderness.)\\n\\nI more think this series is interesting in how it talks about the nature of power and The uprising, as a whole, is an upswelling of the people, a realization that there is strength in numbers. Yet some of the most revolutionary actions of this series are individual — it takes Katniss’ desire to save her sister to start a war, Katniss’ love for little Rue to create horror, Cinna’s willingness to sacrifice his life to create a symbol. Even during war, the individual lives of characters like Joanna and Haymitch and Finnick . They matter to the narrative, and thus they matter to us too.\\n\\n\\n\\nKatniss Everdeen is still a deeply revolutionary heroine not only in that she’s written to be fairly gender non-conforming but also in that she is outwardly cold to all but her very few favorite people, and the narrative does not see fit to her for it, but to empathize with her and allow her to grow naturally in small ways. Her journey is not in becoming a Nice Person but in self-actualization. That is not a journey female characters are ever ever ever allowed to take and is arguably still something new.\\n\\nI almost want to case study this. It’s a similar dynamic to Lord of the Rings being blamed for the general problems of late-1900s fantasy... but worse, because criticism of the YA dystopian genre so often fell into somewhat misogynistic areas, and I don’t think there’s any point in denying that , due to having an image as Something Young Women Enjoyed™️, received far more criticism than its equivalents in other genres.\\n\\nIt's crazy that the first big ya dystopia is the best ya dystopia and one of the best series of all time, but this one is truly a classic and remains so incredible. Thank you to Katniss Everdeen for being one of the most interesting characters ever written and to this book for having such a dynamic story.\\n\\n| | | | | |\\n\\n\\n—————\\n\\n\\n1. The parallels to our own society are so amazingly drawn, and the worldbuilding so good, that I'm not surprised this book was the one that broke through.\\n2. Tell me you weren't on the edge of your seat every moment of this book. You're lying. Katniss' struggle to survive on her own is compelling and twisty. Every moment is filled with fear and tension.\\n3. Katniss Everdeen is one of the best developed, most intriguing protagonists ever written. She's badass and she's selfish and she takes no shit. In the end, I think that's what made this series so fantastic and popular.\"},\n",

I would like to thank this book for such amazing description of dystopian world.\\n\\n\\nThis is a kind of book which probably everyone has read including their dogs, cats and birds too!\\nSo there is no need to hide the spoilers but as warning-\\n\\nThis book started brilliantly and within few pages sucked me into it. The . Introduction to districts, new society, people’s life, the rules, the reaping, and yes ‘The hunger Games’. It is fast paced with simplistic writing. These are all good things. The best part kids are starting to read the books.\\nBut that’s where the good things end.\\nSuzanne Collins created the opportunity (golden ones) and one by one she destroyed it. But still most of the people are enthralled by the book as it eventually came out. But I’m not.\\nSo I’m going to tell very explicitly what I didn’t like...\\n\\n\\nThis story has been told through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, she just doesn't give a damn about anyone else except her family so naturally the other characters are too shallow and one dimensional.\\nMany people just love Peeta and Katniss but I don’t like either of them. was that he liked Katniss from age of five, saved her twice and is now in love with Katniss, rest is mystery.\\n, she does a lot of thing (infact she does everything in the book) but never has a second thought about them, never reflect over what she has done, eventually no attachment with the character.\\nbecause these are few characters that spent time with Katniss, but (again)no character has depth.\\nOne more outcome that I feel from other reviews is that Katniss is definitely heroine of the story but why make other 10 kids villain. While Cato and Clove make their kill they become monster but when Katniss makes her kill, it has to be justified as revenge for killing Rue and pity killing of Cato.\\nThis book is all about ...\\n\\n\\nThe plot is so much predictable that I was surprised after every 10 or 20 pages (I’m not out of my mind) because the story would turn out exactly how I would guess. First I thought that maybe my mind is highly synchronised with Collins’s mind but later on reading other reviews it turned out the plot was predictable.\\n\\n\\nThis could have been much more interesting novel. Where did it all go wrong? As I’m writing, everything wrong in story to me looks like is outcome of first person perspective.\\n--I would have felt much more connected to the games had it contained a bit of background information of every important tributes. Despite the killings being graphical, I didn’t felt sad for their deaths.\\n--, she moves over to do other things (because Rue is dying). But later when she realises that it was her first kill, still she doesn’t reflect over it even for a minute. Killing other human has effect on the killer, until and unless killer is sociopath, moreover here the killers are kids. Instead of giving insight to their mind the story flatly moves ahead with killing and ending the games.\\n\\n\\nI read books because I enjoy it and because they push my mind to a new level of thinking which benefit me. This book made me think only about, why I didn’t like this book when whole world is enjoying this. No further thoughts beyond that.\\n\\nMaciek’s thought on this book:\\n\\nFOR ALL THIS\\nIn many reviews people come out with most lame excuse (defense) I have ever heard-\\nAs for other books in the series, I will definitely read them but I’m not in hurry or excited with this prospect. I will read it someday, probably before second installment of the movie.\\n\\n\\n- I watched the movie\\nturned out pretty good, much better than I had anticipated. As I watched the movie it seemed that novel was written with movie in mind. Few minor changes, like in the end President Snow shown thinking representing its start of story unlike novel which ends. Some scenes are breath taking, too much violence. Acting by Jennifer Lawrence is good (she turned out better than Katniss in the book). I liked the movie, rated it 7/10.\\n\\nThis review is inspired by and .\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'I sat down to this book prepared to be captivated in its pages. But I was disappointed. I was always expecting that finally the author would show her genius and knock me off my feet. But it never happened. Yes, it was exciting and entertaining. But it wasn\\'t a truly great book.\\n\\nI could not stop comparing this to Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. Like Fahrenheit 451, it was a dystopian novel set in the future, but Fahrenheit 451 had significant symbolism on every page, paragraph, and even half the sentences. I was so scared because it was so life-like and realistic. I could see how undeniably prophetic Bradbury was and how we are slowly, ever so slowly, slipping closer and closer to that world. I saw the similarities of the worlds; I felt inspired to stop us from falling into that trap too.\\n\\nBut The Hunger Games never provoked me to think or inspired me to act. It was like a roller-coaster. You get on and momentarily take an exciting spin. But that\\'s all. You\\'re just taken there. You\\'re not drawn in. You don\\'t have to do anything. You just sit there and your stomach flops over and over as opposed to your mind working, thinking, puzzling, imagining. The writing style wasn\\'t even good, and the grammar was actually quite poor. What really annoyed me about the writing style was that I knew paragraphs before if something exciting was going to happen. Just the way that Suzanne Collins wrote blew away the whole surprise and shock of an attack.\\n\\nI ended up asking, \"So what?\" She could have awoken the reader to real problems by showing us what could happen if we don\\'t take action. But she never really got to the point. She focused instead on entertaining us, on giving us a sob story. There was so much potential in this book. What I\\'m trying to say is that there was so much that Suzanne Collins could have done to make this book a masterpiece like Fahrenheit 451. But she just didn\\'t.\\n\\nI do want to read the next book though. I\\'ll take another ride on the roller-coaster.'},\n",

So maybe Matthew Fox from Lost isn\\'t exactly the person you had in mind when you thought about who they might cast as Katniss in The Hunger Games, but I was inspired to create that after I saw You might want to wait to visit it, though, because it can suck you in like an unexplained time warp flash.\\n\\nI was also inspired to create the Jackniss after I read a discussion that deeply disturbed me.\\n\\nSomewhere, possibly on Goodreads, I read that someone thought the . What!?!? Forget the genius Suzanne Collins, let\\'s give it to the guys who left the greatest mystery in all of TV history completely unexplained. Don\\'t get me wrong. I love Lost and appreciate it greatly, but they really explained nothing in terms of the plot. But don\\'t even get me started on that - Circuits overloading. Bzzzt. *sparks*\\n\\nBoth Lost and Hunger Games are great character stories, but Hunger Games plot. It cannot do without. That\\'s obviously not going to happen since Suzanne has already written the script, but just play along for a second.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow,, I won\\'t even try to justify why you should. You just should. This is just one of those books that someone says \"This book is AMAZING.\" Then, you take their word for it and read it.\\n\\nAnd seriously, WHY haven\\'t you read it yet?\\n\\nThis is the kind of book that is so awesome in a completely thrilling and demented and emotional and shocking way that it makes you want to bang your head against the wall while throwing fairy dust in joy. Two things that I have done in the past, but before at the same time. That\\'s how powerful this book is.\\n\\nAfter that, it makes you want to cry. Cry like a little baby. Like a little baby in it\\'s crib. Then scream. Scream like a frikkin banshee with a frikkin laser beam on it\\'s forehead.\\n\\nBefore I read this, I had a friend who told me that this book was 100 times better than Twilight. (I\\'d say that it\\'s actually more like a gorgonzolazillion times better and don\\'t ask me the exact amount that represents. Let\\'s just call it \"To infinity and beyond.\") She also said that it was going to be an even bigger phenomenon than Twilight. I was like \"Hah!\" Let\\'s face it, it can get ridiculous with the Fangirl mobbing and the crying. But I concur. I think this WILL be bigger than Twilight and obviously better. Maybe even Oscar worthy. I certainly hope so, anyway.\\n\\nI know that I said I wouldn\\'t try and talk you into reading this book but I honestly can\\'t help it. I\\'m not sure that I\\'m doing a great job at it, though. Let\\'s try a little visual aid.\\n\\nHere is an artist\\'s rendering of our heroine, Katniss Everdeen:\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd here\\'s the gorgeous young lady who has been cast. Jennifer Lawrence.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe may not seem like the spitting image of the girl from the book, but there is such a thing as hair dye and dirt. And and there is Photoshop, of course. So here is a pic that someone made and posted online of Jennifer as Katniss. It may change your mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd this side by side.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll right, besides the oversized cartoon eye, she is pretty damn close. Well, I\\'m convinced. How bout you?\\n\\n\\nAs if that wasn\\'t enough, :\\n\\n\\nAlso, here\\'s the artists version of Peeta, our hero.\\n\\n\\n\\nI know that a lot of people would disagree but, to me, guy is Peeta.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd just so everyone knows - The Hunger Games is currently .\\n\\nDownload it .\\n\\nI\\'m not sure how long the sale will last, though.

       "    'review': \"May the odds be ever in your favour\\n\\nPanem is a nation that lies in what used to be known as North America with a Capitol which is surrounded by 12 districts. To discourage rebellion the Capitol forces each district to send a tribute of one boy and one girl a year to participate in The Hunger Games. A deadly competition which is aired live on TV, and in the end there is only one victor, only one survivor.\\n\\n\\n\\nKatniss Everdeen, a sixteen year old girl from district 12, volunteers to take the place of her little sister in the games. Luckily Katniss is used to surviving under the harshest circumstances. But what Katniss doesn't realise is that being able to kill and hunt is not the only things that will help her stay alive but also forming friendships, alliances, and making sure the audience likes her.\\n\\n\\nPicking up this book again had me transported to my younger THG obsessed self. I find myself thinking about the hunger games quite often. And how nothing I've read since 2012 has ever had such an impact on me.\\n\\nI will always admire Katniss's love for her sister. Her strength and unwillingness to give up. She's spent so long in survival mode that it's hard for her to have normal relationships with people and she constantly questions everyone's motives. I must say though that's probably what kept her alive in the arena.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRereading this was a whole other experience. It's been almost 10 years since I first read these books, I noticed things I didn't before. Things that annoyed me then, are clearer to me now and I think I connected to the characters even more than I did back in my first read.\\n\\nThe writing is not very descriptive. It has little embellishments but I think it does a good job of reflecting Katniss's personality, who is a very straight forward and ‘no-nonsense’ type of person.\\n\\nAnd while I'm not really a fan of books being told in the first person, I don't mind reading Katniss's POV. The writing is still very immersive and I think Collins did a good job of making the reader feel part of the story.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fast pacing and action keeps you hooked. I can't even explain the on edge feeling you get while reading this. Even for me who has already read this book and watched the movie countless times.\\n\\nOver the years I've fallen out of love with dystopian books and in general I don't really like books set in the future. I know, I know what is wrong with me right?!\\nMaybe it's because, , nothing really compares to THG.\\n\\nThe setting is so unique. I love how the bareness of district 12 is described compared to the ostentation of the Capitol.\\n\\nThe world of the hunger games is definitely not one I'd ever want to visit ; )\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'll admit I became very emotional (are we even surprised by now) while rereading this. I think it's because I already know what's in-store for the characters.\\n\\nI found it immensely funny how suspicious she was of Peeta and his genuine kindness.\\n\\n\\n\\nAh, Peeta Mellark. Our sweet cinnamon roll. He's just so: ❤🐣🌻🌞✨\\nLiterally can't believe there are people out there shipping Katniss with Gale when we have our precious baker right here.\\n\\nThe part where be said : — had me crying like a baby. My love for Peeta Mellark knows no bounds.\\n\\nMaybe I didn't notice before because I was more concerned for Katniss but this time my heart really felt for Haymitch. Even when you win the games there's still no escaping them. And besides his own horrors he had to face in the games and other things the Capitol did to him, every year he had to watch as two more kids got killed, for which he most likely feels responsible. I never really gave much thought before to how he coped with all that.\\n\\nI love the movies and for a long time I believed that they were so great that it might not even be necessary to read the books as long as you've seen the movies (which are master pieces. in my opinion the best adaptations of all time) but during this reread I realised that there is an element to the books that could not be translated to screen. The movies are good companions to the books but could never replace them.\\n\\nIf you have not read I highly suggest you try them out. It's never too late! They are great to read no matter your age, but I think they're also really great for young teens who are starting to get into reading or even those who are reluctant readers. Personally these books opened up other world's to me and will always hold a prestigious spot on my shelves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___\\nRereading this for the first time since i read it way back when!! i already feel like I'm back in 2012 when everyone was so hyped about the movie.\\n\\n___\\n\\nI was planning to reread these books this year but with coming out in 2020 I'll rather wait closer to that release date.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"~SO THIS IS WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT~\\nTHE HUNGER GAMES is a fantastic, breathless and somewhat brutal read that once you start you simply can’t put down again. Initially I had no idea what this book was about or what to expect in terms of YA writing, it had just been recommended to me by so many people and had such a buzz surrounding it that I had to find out for myself why. Well let me say I was not disappointed and have now joined the legions of Suzanne Collins fans in awaiting her next instalment.\\n\\nWritten along the lines of Stephen King’s or Orwell’s (I may be aging myself here) this story still feels very original and sucked me in completely with its modern day Survivor-esque retelling. The Hunger Games is the ultimate in reality TV, suspense, scripted realism, romance and survival that you should not miss.\\n\\nSet in a post apocalyptic future (although we frustratingly never learn the why's, how’s or even when of this future.) This new communist-type America known as Panem has been divided into a Capital and its 12 districts. We follow 16 year old Katniss as she struggles to keep her starving family alive, hunting and gathering with her best friend Gale. Unbeknownst to her these are valuable skills as the annual hunger games are about to begin.\\n\\nEach year these games require two children from each district who are chosen based on a lottery system for compulsory participation. These televised games are then broadcast throughout Panem (with mandatory viewing) as the 24 contestants fight each other to the death, leaving just one victor at its violent conclusion. It’s kind of like Survivor but instead of being voted off the island you have to kill your competitors. When Katniss’s younger sister is chosen as the female contestant from their district Katniss volunteers to take her place. Then together with Peeta the other lottery winner they travel to the capital and begin preparations for the opening ceremonies and ultimately their death in The Hunger Games.\\n\\nOddly this has been written without paragraph breaks and I have to admit the first part of it dragged for me, as Katniss is groomed, clothed, and schooled by her entourage within the capital. However as soon as the games begin, lookout! By this point in the story you have become attached to several key characters and its then that you realize things can’t end well as there will be only one winner. Over a period of about 2 weeks and against overwhelming odds we watch 24 victims dwindle as they struggle to survive. Simultaneously avoiding and hunting each other they form alliances, face hunger and mind numbing thirst, mutant animal attacks, friendship, love and ultimately a distrust of everyone as Big Brother raises the stakes to keep the audience interested.\\n\\nThis is an exciting book that will keep you up late into the night and resonate with you long after you’ve finished.

       "    'review': \"The Hunger Games is relevant. Today, more so than ever, it is relevant. The recent happenings of the world have left me questioning between what is real and what is fiction. The lines have blurred. They always have been but - today, more so than ever, it is evident.\\n\\nLittle me didn't understand the true depth of this series. For her, being a person who may not have been a citizen of the Capitol but still someone who could eat three meals a day, go to school, have a happy childhood with no worries; the biggest worry for that girl used to be was who Katniss was going to end up with. . The million dollar question.\\n\\nBut now that i'm older, now that i am slowly feeling the burden of responsibilities, now that i can see how the people of this world are, now that i've been exposed to our world - I can how relevant this book is.\\n\\nEverytime i discuss this book with someone the first question always seems to be: Gale or Peeta? I understand these questions to some extent. They are easier to ask. Easier to start a conversation with. But i can't help but think that this was the entire message of Hunger Games. How literal killing of children was going on in the games but the people of Capitol were dumbing it down to the romance of two people. I'm not criticizing people who like Everlark, hell, i'm one of their biggest fans.\\n\\nBut as compelling the romantic aspect is, it's so so crucial to remember that .\\n\\nIt boggles my mind when i'm scrolling on social media and one video is of a hospital being bombed (🍉) or a mother crying over her dead baby and the next is some Hollywood celebrity looking like a peacock on the Met Gala Carpet. It sickens me to no extent. The fact that i can look at this extravagance and tell myself that the people of Capitol would end up wearing it should be enough of a proof. YES it is their money and they can do whatever the hell with it, they can have fun but this kind of decadence is crazy to me.\\n\\nSeeing things like this reminds me of that conversation that occurs between Plutarch Heavensbee and Snow in Catching Fire:\\n\\n\\n\\nand this critique on how society can become desensitized to real suffering while focusing on the trivial, sensational and the frivolous aspects of life - isn't that what's going on in our world?\\n\\nThere are so so many better reviews and video essays that have explained this in a much better and more detailed way that i have or i can. But i appreciate Suzanne Collins so so much for this book.\\n\\nI remember that quote from George Orwell that goes like:\\n\\nand isn't that the ultimate truth?\\n\\nReading this book always ends up shaking me to my core. An absolutely amazing series. I will never stop recommending it.\"},\n",

       "    'review': '10 years ago I read The Hunger Games for the first time and loved it.\\n\\nA decade later and I am still absolute trash for The Hunger Games!!\\n\\nOk, so there seems very little point in providing a synopsis - almost everyone would have heard about this series in one way or another.\\n\\nI’ll just list why I love this book:\\n\\n- How well it stands up even 10 years later. This book came out when YA dystopia was all the rage, and while I’d say most of the others have not aged well The Hunger Games remains relevant even now.\\n\\n- The politics. A world where 12 districts are kept in slave like conditions after a revolt against their cruel captors fails. Forced into sending their children to fight in a battle to the death as a constant reminder to know their place. Not to rock the boat. Relevant.\\n\\n- I even like the romance/fake romance. Whatever you believe is going on. I love Katniss’ indecision - it’s so realistic. I love Gale and Peeta. Though ultimately I am team Peeta.\\n\\n- The characters. Katniss is a great main character. She isn’t the typical YA heroine, not many people like her, she is brash, honest and uptight and I love her.\\nAlso all the side characters are so well formed, full of flaws but ultimately fantastic. One of my absolute favourites being Haymitch.\\n\\n- You are constantly on the edge of your seat. Never boring, always terrified what will happen next. Just so unputdownable.\\n\\nFinally, not book related specifically but I love how well the films represent the book. There is one major thing they didn’t include which is a shame\\nBut there are so many scenes that made it to the films and I loved it.'},\n",

       "    'review': \"Well this book lived up to a lot of the hype that surrounds it. While the name and cover still do not grab my attention the story, once started, did.\\n\\nThis book is written in first perspective, from the heroine's aspect. Her name is Katniss Everdeen. She starts off in her home, a simple, poor area of the land. She is the provider for her mother and sister with her hunting skills. To protect her younger sister, she is sent to the capitol, along with local boy Peeta, to 'participate' in the annual Hunger Games.\\n\\nThese 'games' are fights to the death, aired and shown to the capitol and all 12 districts under its control, in a survival arena of sorts. The book shows, throughout the story, a somewhat futuristic dystopia society. The tributes (Katniss, Peeta and others in the game) are given basic weapons (bows, spears, clubs) and the district where Katniss is from uses herbs and eats basic foods (squirrel, wild turkey, etc) but the capitol has voice command room service, automatic hair dryers, and a camera/screen set that tracks and shows the tributes (no matter where they go) to the viewers. It is an interesting combination.\\n\\nThere is a 'romantic' setting as well. Katniss and Peeta are to appear as a united team to the people. Peeta even admits to liking her during his interview. So a setting for 'star-crossed lovers' is created. However, Katniss has various feelings toward Peeta throughout the book and its very realistic and understandable, especially when there is possibly another guy back home.\\n\\nYet while there are time I can relate to her, at the same time several of her thoughts want to make my roll my eyes or drop my head onto a desk. While she is survival smart, she is not people smart. She can't socialize and cannot read people worth a darn. While it is annoying at times, it is also endearing and has created a unique character.\\n\\nOverall, very good book. 4 1/2 stars is my official opinion, but I will give it 5 since I can't do halves. Its a constant pace of survival, and action with just the right touch of romantic possibilities. I look forward to the next book.\\n\\n2023- Audiobook. This time I really wondered why Haymitch made the choices he made. What was happening in the Capitol and how hard did he try to get them help. What help did others get? I liked seeing how level-headed Katniss is yet still had flaws and made a few poor choices (or at least potentially poor). I was hooked about her relation to Rue and how she even confused her with her sister a bit. That would not be the place for that type of thought!\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'I’ve had this book recommended to me several times over the years. I don’t know why. Not only is this book completely terrible, but it is also not the sort of thing I would normally read. I did, however, approach this book with an open mind. I expected to like it, but not love it. What I didn’t expect was to hate it so passionately. There are just too many things wrong with it. In all honesty I do not understand the success this book has achieved. For me, it is complete rubbish.\\n\\n\\n\\nI find it impossible to accept this world. It wasn’t because it was a nasty place, but because it wasn’t believable. The Capitol puts on these Hunger Games and sacrifices countless children in the process. I mean….what? Children. Why would the Capitol do this? If I was in charge of the Capitol I would have developed a much more effective system. I’d have fixed the games so the leaders of each district were sacrificed each year. That way there would be no one left to lead an uprising against the Capitol. And those left in the districts wouldn’t have the courage or reason to lead an uprising. They’d want to keep their heads down because they would be sacrificed next if they too led a rebellion. Problem solved. Capitol rules the districts in oppressive peace.\\n\\nThat’s beside the point, though, because the cruelty of sacrificing is also too far-fetched. The residents of the Capitol are vain and greedy, but vain and greedy is a long way off from sadistic and brutal. I found it difficult to accept that in the Capitol there wasn’t streets filled with violent protestors trying to save the lives of these kids. It just didn’t work for me. The children are far too accepting and almost stoic when they are selected. I would go kicking and screaming. Their families just watch them go and accept; then they rebel later, idiots. The children also don’t seem to be that afraid. They may have become used to the process, but surely the horror of this situation would lead to panic attacks and break downs?\\n\\nThen there are the games themselves. The whole thing is recorded by invisible cameras. There is a whole world of wrong with that. It seems to me like Collins wrote herself into a box and the only solution she could come up with was “I know I’ll make the cameras invisible!” Then there is the idea of Peeta’s camouflage skills. Basically, Collins suggests that because Peeta was a baker and decorated his cakes artfully, despite the district being in poverty, he can then camouflage his entire body into the surroundings of the arena using his said cake decorating skills. Now, that was plain stupid. I don’t think she thought these ideas through enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuzanne Collins writes in an incredibly simple manner. There is no eloquence in her expression and prose; it is all very lifeless and flat, just like her world and characters. This may be for a younger audience, but that doesn’t excuse the blandness of her writing: it’s weak and unimaginative. I’m not sure if she purposely wrote in this way or if that’s just how she writes in general, but either way the result is a book that appears as if it’s been written by a ten year old. The sentence structure is basic, and very rarely changes. This can work if the language feels powerful, but if doesn’t. The whole novel feels elementary.\\n\\nThe characters are just as bad. The obvious romance that has, and is, being created is just tiresome. I don’t think this should have included the romance complication. I think Collins should have focused more upon writing a realistic story before she delved into the complexities of teenage relationships. This, again, was simple and straightforward. I literally have nothing positive to say about this book. For me, it doesn’t have a single redeeming feature or quality: it is just utter drivel.\\n\\nEverything about this book is basic and weak. No doubt, I shall receive a string of comments from people defending this book, but this is just my opinion of it. I’m not wrong and neither are you. This is simply my opinion of a terribly overrated, poorly considered and badly written book. Deal with it. I welcome discussion, but not those who are going to simply say that I’m wrong with no reasoning behind their argument. Also, this is another of those rare cases when the movie is actually better than the book. This says a lot because the movie is awful.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I absolutely hate this book and don’t recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n\\n1. The Hunger Games-\\n2. Catching Fire-\\n3.

       "    'review': 'well after its initial release, the hunger games remains one of the most popular dystopian book series. some people say mainstream media has inherently little value, believing it to be overhyped and overrated. but i think the hunger games deserves all (or at least most) of the praise it’s gotten.\\n\\nsome thoughts:\\n\\n❖ just take a moment to think about this. you’re put in an arena, against your will, to hunt down 23 of your peers. 23 kiddos who may not be entirely innocent but don’t quite deserve to die either. and sure, you can choose not to hurt them. but that means giving up your life. kill or be killed. the thought is truly horrifying. i can’t begin to describe how clever a premise this is — how much it allows for in terms of critiquing the world we live in. it is brilliant. the social commentary is seamlessly woven into the plot, into the characters and their arcs, into every little detail of the story, making it truly worthy of being categorized as dystopian.\\n\\n❖ i think it’s interesting that katniss was portrayed as the girl on fire from the very beginning. in simple terms, fire burns. and many times throughout the book, katniss has quietly rebelled. but i suspect in the next two books that will change — from something quieter to a full blown uprising. she is the spark that ignites the revolution.\\n\\n❖ it’s easy to hate the other tributes because katniss is our protagonist, the person we’ve been rooting for from the very first page. but it’s important to acknowledge that it is the capitol who is truly at fault. everyone else is just a product of the society in which they were brought up, not completely blameless, but trying desperately to survive under a government that wants them to suffer.\\n\\nit’s been fifteen years, yet this book is as relevant as ever.\\n\\n—\\n\\nidk why this took me SO long to read but i have a lot to say so rtc!!'},\n",

       "    'review': \"**On a second reading after over a decade, I am forced to recognize that The Hunger Games is terrific, well-paced entertainment (at least for the first two-thirds; the cave-dwelling drags on long enough to disrupt the momentous action in service of the relationship angle that vexed me on my initial reading).\\n\\nThe prose is superior to and more engaging than in most sub-standard fare of similar categories, with an appreciable amount more gruesomeness and visceral detail than I recalled. The only habit of Collins that grated on me this time around was her frequent implementation of tautological descriptions of food and garments:\\n-dress = a soft blue thing\\n-sheets = soft, silky fabric\\n-hot chocolate = hot, sweet, creamy liquid\\n-wine = tart, dry liquid\\nI can accept it as Katniss not being familiar with these products of luxury, describing her first experience with them in clunky, basic terms, but I’d have accepted paragraph long revelatory soliloquies over mundanely stating the obvious that most beverages are indeed liquids.\\n\\nI’ll let my original review stand, with caveats, but I’m bumping it up a half star for being no less enjoyable the second time around and maintaining my interest enough to finally give the sequels a go.**\\n\\n\\nDespite its exposure and fame, I managed not to acquire any knowledge of this phenomenon prior to cracking the spine for the first time. The cover might as well have a Mr. Yuck sticker on it with that pendant and stupid crop-circle design that gives the impression of a story about child secret agents or something. This was sufficient enough for quite some time to repel me. But now, let’s see what we’ve actually got here:\\n\\nKid’s book about a continent-ally broadcasted snuff film.\\n\\n\\n\\nI refuse (as best I can) to hold young adult fiction to a different standard than all other fiction. A younger target demographic should not garner leniency or its corollary prejudice, perfunctory dismissal. I am not exemplary in keeping with this sentiment as my own predilections after experiences with household titles of the ‘genre’ like and the endless crop of crap since soured me to anything to be found in the YA section. I have been harboring a mentality of ‘kids-today’ intransigence. So, I have a low standard for popular teen series (I’m not suggesting this is anything more than incidental, but this realm tends to be dominated by female authors) and have come to expect scant substance in plot or character development.\\n\\nHowever, having indicted myself on that front and prefacing with that rather obvious point, I am pleased to say that I do not think Suzanne Collins treats her readers—young ones in particular—like idiots. Many of her readers were mere toddlers, infants, or yet to be conceived on that infamous day in September of 2001, and have grown up in a world that is very distinguishable from the world we knew before. They are coming of age in a world of increasing uncertainty, of static fear, and a minimal amount of hope.\\n\\nI was going to attempt to avoid any mention of the film, but allow me to offer one quote from the supercilious ‘President’ of Panem, Coriolanus Snow: Spoken like a true (and intelligent) dictator. Saddam could have learned something if only he’d clutched to power (and life) in time to hear it. This book speaks to the potential grimness of the future, as well as paralleling tribulations and distractions of the past.\\n\\nAs for ‘The Games’, just what would it take for a society to descend into such madness, again (see next section)? Don’t get ahead of me. I won’t get too far into this, but there are risks society is comfortable with for the sake of entertainment right now, ladies and gentlemen. Has anyone ever died for our entertainment? When something ‘goes wrong’ in competitive sports, we talk about how sad and shocking it is, until we blithely sit down for the next game/match. I’m not making a social statement so much as suggesting that considering ourselves more civilized because we don’t kill people for entertainment purposes any longer may be slightly naive. (Not to mention that political division seems to point to us gladly throwing one another to the lions).\\n\\nHowever thin and sophomoric this analogy may be, we want violence with consequences for people in our entertainment, whether as participant or spectator. (I've had broken noses and knuckles to attest to this). It’s been inherent to our species since, well, boredom (a pesky consequence of consciousness). I apologize, but this had to make it into a review .\\n\\n\\nDystopian and post-apocalyptic scenarios in literature are nothing terribly groundbreaking any longer, but I haven’t heard too many critics making the claim that this book ‘rips off’ or . What else is there to focus on? Ah, yes, a pitting-against-each-other of young people with no personal qualms or vendettas against one another for the entertainment and disillusionment of the general populace who are collected, or “reaped” in a public display of revolutionary peacekeeping dominance and subjugation. What does that remind us of? Oh, right! Say it with me everyone! (I won’t get into this again). Indeed there blatant literary hack jobs, for which the words ‘inspired by’ may absolutely not be applied. There are also retellings ( and are masterful and imaginative in their own respective rights without even needing to evoke anything Homeric). We recognize the source, judge with equanimity, and conclude based on what they bring the story, or what source elements they use to or their story. We do (I speak optimistically) fling accusatory excrement of imitation or fraudulence simply because comparisons can be drawn between something and something else. I cannot speak as to whether or not Collins drew any direct inspiration from Koushun Takami (or Ancient Rome), but this book appears to be neither a hack job nor a riding-on-the-coattails of anything that preceded it.\\n\\nthe retroactively, refreshingly imperfect heroine thinks to herself, arousing unexpected respect from yours truly. In this particular instance, she makes the best of the environment in which she finds herself as darkness seems to be closing in on her. If there is ever that chance that it will be the end, it is easy to focus on what could be the last scent, or sensation one experiences. The fatigue, the accumulated stress and piled-on pain, the anguish and concealed desperation (not to mention the sleep deprivation the night before ‘The Games’ begin). It is all conveyed by Katniss with such vulnerable clarity that simple human empathy is only the first stage in coming to relate to her.\\n\\nHer second-guessing w/r/t everything Peeta says, or does (including saving her life) is significant beyond the context of wanting to survive. Her anxiety over these matters is no idle inner monologue, but validates for us our precarious dispositions when considering ulterior motives when someone pays us a kindness. These neuroses are not always justified, but they are unavoidable as dictated by our nature; one of those refreshing imperfections I was referring to above.\\n\\n\\n\\nI will gloss over the less-than-necessary love triangle aspect as it seems to be the prominent point of ridicule for the more ‘serious’ readers (albeit I could think of reasons to defend it). The first person narrative grants us access to Katniss’ every thought, but the ending of this first installment is one of romantic ambiguity nonetheless. We have a better idea of Peeta’s true feelings by this point, but I am among the cohort who cares little for this—what I would deem—subplot.\\n\\nGeneric, overpowered Katniss is not (at least not in this first book, and not enough to suspend all suspension of disbelief). Katniss is not out for blood. She is not an annoying man-hater trying to smash the patriarchy by bitching at the young men entrapped under precisely the same circumstances in which she finds herself; she is a reticent, unintentional badass, which is the only kind worthy of the title, as far as I am concerned. (This novel has the benefit of being written before that trope was all but required in mainstream entertainment, and for that, I am relieved).\\n\\nI made a joke to myself as I neared the end of the novel. “When do the vampires come in?” I cynically asked. Little did I know that werewolf-like creatures were soon to make their debut. I didn’t hate the implementation (and it was better than what the film did), and upon realizing that they were, in fact, the reanimated, mutated corpses of her former adversaries (and sweet, furry little Rue), Katniss was provided with further existential speculation. Did these creatures want revenge, did they possess the memories along with the molecules of their (former?) selves, or are they autonomous killing machines? Also, what the hell happened to them after they scampered off? Perhaps I’ll find out. But!... but, beyond that it came off as more teen-pandering fantasy fare that detracted from the verisimilitude I had hitherto gotten used to. I realize the novel is often classified as sci-fi, but this stretched the limits of what I expected. ; I suppose the pun works, though.\\n\\nThen, when ‘The Games’ are finished and Claudius Templesmith revokes his previous announcement that two winners will be allowed (dun, dun, dun!) and Katniss has the brilliant idea of a faux-suicide-pact, prompting Claudius to revoke his revocation in a graceless sort of kind of way, it just didn’t work. I understand it was meant to transmit humiliation for ‘The Capitol’, but it really came off as Collins pulling off a last-ditch effort at a final twist (of the most expected and trite variety). Unless it was meant to be religious satire (Abraham, Isaac, a goat, God, you know) it was not a particularly meaningful note on which to conclude the violence. No gasps were induced. A shrug was too much to muster.\\n\\nI’ll cut myself off there with those couple examples. The book has flaws, but they were not so numerous or egregious that it ruined the overall experience. The writing quality has its flaws just like the plot, but it’s pretty damn good for the most part. It is mostly straightforward storytelling, but doesn’t slouch on elegant, effective prose that youngsters can understand:\\n\\n\\n\\nI can’t help but think that the political allegory, which can be interpreted into any narrative, is rather overstated, if not mostly unfounded (to say nothing of the liberal-conservative ‘debate’ since the film’s release of whose ideals it best represents, but you don't get a seizing of the means of production like that outside Communism, just saying). The things I discussed in my opening statements are not inherent in this story, rather what I gathered when I read into it. They logically follow, I believe, from what the story itself forthrightly presents us with, but to read this as some kind of for our future, save for the conceivable degeneration of risk-taking entertainment into near-deliberate killing, is sailing out to sea a little bit. I may be starting to contradict myself, so I will take my leave.\\n\\nOops…\"},\n",

I’ll never forget reading this book for the first time, and that moment of wondering if this could all become a reality, and weighing my own mortality a little more heavily than I had before.\\n\\n\\nDoom and gloom aside, this is one of my favorite books of all time and it has not lost an ounce of its spark for me. To this day, I think Katniss is one of the most courageous, sensible, and inspiring protagonists I’ve ever seen. I’m still more than a little in love with Cinna, I’ll never fix the crack in my heart from sweet Rue, and I’ll always root for the boy with the bread. As an adult and a mother, everything in me hurts so much more for these poor, broken tributes — even the vicious, bloodthirsty ones who don’t know anything else — and I’m endlessly amazed by the world that Suzanne Collins created in Panem.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBuddy read with and !'},\n",

       "    'review': \"Before I pile praise upon praise on The Hunger Games’ capital concept, plotting, brutality, symbolism, characters, dynamics,\\u200c suspense, intrigue, and themes, I need to get the negative out of the way and address why #TheMovieDidItBetter:\\n\\nAt the time of the writing of this book, Suzanne Collins was not, , a storyteller.\\n\\nShe was a story-maker, yes, but not teller. And consequently, she established THG as a rare exception to rule. I’m sure you’ve heard this rule going from mouth to mouth, screen to screen, drive to drive; perhaps you’re even one of the people who deny the validity of such a claim—if yes, then let’s talk it out. To understand how a rule can be broken, we need to learn what it in the first place. So, anyone up for more-than-a-little analysis?\\n\\n()\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWords are tricky things; they can touch, paint, smell, shine, sound, sing, bleed, feel, tear, hurt, stab, steal, swallow, spill. That is the power of language.\\n\\nA book’s writing and prose is not equivalent to the writing of a film’s screenplay (), but the directing of the film. The same way authors capture the essence and ambience of a book through descriptions and turns of phrase—wielding words as a swordsman would a blade or an archer a bow and arrow—directors build the atmosphere and weave the tale using methods such as determining the lighting, colouring, angle of the camera, etc etc.\\n\\nBut whatever one might do, directors are at a disadvantage, because there is one thing they cannot do; How, you wonder?\\n\\nTake the sense of smell, as an example. Authors convey it with the way it’s described (), directors with the way it’s shown (). But can they both ensnare thoughts and concealed feelings? The answer is simple: directors cannot achieve it without using words (), except if they said thoughts and feelings through occasional trips into the person’s head and depicting them through visualisation; which would be incredible, but one must admit it would be confusing and most would not care for it.\\n\\nThus, Say, if it’s a character they would not possibly relate to, or one who has barely any redeeming actions and they could not otherwise feel for, writers have the weapon and power to still make their audience understand the character—without having them explain it to someone else, as directors have to, with their hands tied as it is.\\n\\nThe question is, why do I believe adaptation for the big screen was better than the original book?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow me to ask for the help of a metaphor in driving my exhausted point home and letting it rest ():\\n\\n\\n\\nTell me, what score would this chef get in a cooking contest?\\n\\nSuzanne Collins’ writing of the first installment in her YA dystopian trilogy is absolutely weak and lacking, failing to do justice to the perfection that are all other aspects of the book, and then some. Not only is it the epitome and definition of the ultimate “” problem, barely giving reports of most events and falling short in the “” department, it is even unsatisfactory in the telling. Frankly, it’s closer to a screenplay than than a novel. No wonder the movie is better, filling in all the blanks left by Collins’ pen.\\n\\nAlas, I think that’s enough complaining for one day; it’s time to swoon!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na dark and bloody reality TV show following the lives of children and teens of the oppressed districts and throwing them into an arena to kill eachother until one remains standing, all used as a means to controlling the masses? are not strong enough words for the utter brilliance of this idea. And it’s not just the penning of the idea—but also its execution—that has turned this book into a thing of exceptional value.\\n\\n\\naside from the main theme () there is the ever present proof that Katniss accomplishes none of what she does, alone, helped and spurred by Cinna, Peeta, and Haymitch, making it pleasantly realistic; there is the overtaking of a human’s survival instincts; the trauma induced by living on a constant fight-or-flight setting; the politics of oppression and control and capitalism; and music, oh music which I appreciate indefinitely. All inspired and unforgettable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhowever much I might whine about how Suzanne Collins told the tale, you will find me equally praising how she the tale—the elements, the events, the scenes, their mix and time of delivery, their direction and tightly wrapped manner, the hilarious moments of reprieve and clues and tidbits for cohesively setting the plot of the sequels. I could go on but I shouldn’t ramble, suffice it to say that her plotting is optimum.\\n\\nfirst and foremost, Katniss. She might not be one of my all-time favourite MCs, but she’s close and I love her, because of being a practical, angry fighter who is unapologetically harsh and hostile (); thankfully not the gushing type, she’s also not witty or alluring or cocky or ferocious, which might be more of my fave traits, but her not possessing them is something I like, too—\\n\\nOne assessment I disagree with is her being selfish or cowardly. Trust me, being rather self-absorbed myself, I can tell Katniss is not cut from the same cloth. It’s simply that, for years, her life has been about survival; her focus, the basest needs of humans to continue on living, the needs of herself and her family and friends. Survival has become the language she speaks and operates on. And it’s because of this that her actions could be interpreted as selfish and cowardly where she is quite selfless and brave, and because of this that, at first, she does not comprehend the rebellious thoughts of Gale or Peeta, their desire to say enough. She learns, though. She learns.\\n\\n\\nAnd Peeta! My boy of words and self-deprecating humour, throwing a leash around his audience every time he opens his mouth. People skills is another one of my aforementioned fave traits, and I’ll throw a quick shout-out to the arrogant, insufferable, and destructive Haymitch () and tiresome, clueless yet determined Effie who needs to be protected :')\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto me, one of the gems of this YA debut is the complicated dynamics. I admit, And Katniss with her thoughts of killing vs. protecting Peeta draws me in like a moth to the flame. She’s destructive and he absorbs it, asking for more.\\n\\nThough, I should note that there are two sides to this dynamic: the reality and the act. My words above discuss the real side, as the act had me literally and involuntarily gagging by the end—seeing an angry and vengeful MC I rooted for and somehow related to forcing herself to be reduced to a blushing sweet little girl made me want to repeatedly vomit on my book. Thank goodness for the last few pages.\\n\\nsymbols symbols, how I adore them! We have Panem, the name of the nation, clearly driven from the metonymic phrase which translates into “bread and circuses” and is referring to superficial appeasement; here, namely, that of the Capitol. Symbols are, in general, an area Collins generally excels at ().\\n\\npolitics, methods of oppression, strategies for controlling the masses; mind games, angles to play with, tricks to gaining support and attentions. It’s . Games and intrigue are always the best thing to have in a book.\\n\\nwhile Collins’ writing is not particularly suspenseful in this book—or any of her works, really—the plotting is so commendably and excellently wound that each page is dripping in suspense, creating a constant assault of possibility which is only boosted by my next point of highlight...\\n\\nanyone who knows me, or is aware of how my favourite authors are and knows that I treasure books who don’t pull punches. And a YA with this quality is a rarity I can’t help but be smitten with. In fact, So, beware of the warnings.\\n\\n\\ngraphic violence, murder, blood and gore, alcoholism, loss, PTSD, depression, abandonment, hunting animals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n• The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1) ★★★★☆\\n• (The Hunger Games, #2) ★★★★★\\n• (The Hunger Games, #3) ★★★★½\\n• (The Hunger Games, #0) ★★★★★\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"When it comes to The Hunger Games, I feel like I’m walking into the ballroom in my tuxedo with a bottle of champagne in each hand only to find no one there except for a lone janitor sweeping up confetti along with a couple of people passed out under tables and there's only a bottle of crème de menthe left at the bar. In other words, I’m late to the party.\\n\\nSince I’m so tardy, I don’t think there’s anything I can add, particularly since YA isn’t my usual thing. So I’ll just give it four stars and note a few things that stuck out for me:\\n\\n* I particularly liked the way that Collins portrayed the reality television aspect to the games. The idea that the smart contestants have to play a role in order to get public support even as they’re fighting for their lives was a good way to work some subtle points about the nature of watching people who know they’re being observed.\\n\\n* Collins also did a nice job of depicting the ‘hunger’ aspect of this. The descriptions of the food deprived District 12, Katniss’s constant struggle to literally put bread on the table, and then her fascination with the rich food of the Capital kept you aware of how food was always on her mind. It also had me constantly raiding the fridge.\\n\\n* This reminded me a lot of Stephen King’s (Written under his Richard Bachman alias originally.) in a good way. That story also featured young people competing in a brutal public contest that was orchestrated by the government for the amusement of the masses. This gave me the urge to reread it.\\n\\n* I’ve got a teenage niece who went through an unfortunate phase, but she came through unscathed and is a big fan of this series. I’m tremendously glad about that because I obviously prefer her using the tough and independent Katniss as a role model rather than Bella Swan. I’d rather see her running through the woods hunting humans with a bow-n-arrow rather than pining over pale losers.\"},\n",

And may the odds be ever in your favor.”\\n\\n\\nSo, I haven't read this series since 2012 but decided to refresh my memory on some of the details before the movie for The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is released. I also deliberately avoided the movies all together for a while so I could get the most out of my reread.\\n\\nLemme say this, this is well written, sure. It's no literary masterpiece but it is super entertaining, fast paced and action packed. A page turner, without a doubt.\\n\\nI also think that it has a wide range of readability- I think that whether you're 12 , 21, or 50 that this series will hold your attention and you will be highly invested.\\n\\nFor all 5 people out there in the world that haven't read this here's a brief overview...\\n\\nKatniss Everdeen, the protagonist, is from the poorer section of District 12.\\n\\n\\n\\nHer sister Primrose, who is 12 years old, is chosen as the girl tribute to represent their District in the hunger games, where the tributes fight each other to death. Out of sheer love and fear for Prim’s life, Katniss volunteers as the girl tribute in place of her Prim.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHunger Games are organized and conducted by a group of people referred to as the ‘Gamemakers’. These gamemakers are at liberty to make the Games deadly for the tributes so that they are entertaining for the audience.\\n\\n\\n\\nKatniss is portrayed as a tough girl , who loves her sister Prim more than anyone or anything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHer determination in ensuring Prim’s wellbeing after their father’s death and mother’s depression is explained very well. She would rather tell the truth because she cannot lie convincingly.\\n\\nAs a sharp contrast to Katniss, Peeta is the nice guy who does not care much about winning the game. He has the power of speech and spontaneity with which he sweeps people off their feet.\\n\\n\\n\\nI just want to say that, I don't like Peeta. Like, really not at all. IDK - Maybe I have a thing against nice guys.. but he always comes across so weak and corny and it grates me. ❤︎❤︎❤︎\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI know many people love him because he's such a 'cinnamon roll' but ugh. Just no. That doesn't mean I'm Team Gale, because - no. I think for me, in this series I'm just so Team Katniss that I don't even care about the male love interest.\\n\\n\\n\\nRight from the very first chapter of this book you start to learn about this 'reaping' that occurs within each district and off the bat, you're like oh, okay. So we're just off to the races... yes, you are.\\n\\nThe concept of Hunger Games and reaping and the why of it are explained towards the end of the chapter. There is a clear background on the entire political / social set-up and how people in District 12 fare in comparison to the Capitol.\\n\\nAlso, the story travels along the path of Katniss’s fight to win the Games and to get back to Prim. There are numerous references to Katniss thinking of Prim throughout the book — like, Prim will be getting ready to school now or Prim would have milked the goat by now or Prim will be watching me in the TV screens, I need to be put a brave face, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnexpected alliances between the players, how Katniss learns to manipulate the audience and the sponsors to keep fighting in the games, how she uses her hunting skills for her survival, etc. are described in great detail that it is almost like watching a movie or reading an illustrated book. There is a lot of action and suspense packed in to this book, which keeps you glued to the book.\\n\\nAnyway, still love it MANY years later.\"},\n",

But that's exactly what happened, because it turned out that this story - and I really hope that the whole series - is actually good. I'm not a huge fan of Dystopian young adult books, but once I started reading it, I couldn't stop until the very end.\\n\\n\\nI don't think I need to talk about the plot here because I think a lot of people know what this series is about, but the story really grabbed me from the very beginning. I watched these movies about three times, so I expected certain plot twists and moments, but overall I still felt stressed while reading some scenes. It was a little weird because I know how this trilogy ends - I really hope the books end the same way - and I'm happy with that ending, but I was still afraid that something might happen to the main characters that would probably make me cry as I like them and don't want them to die. Actually, now that I think about it, my trust issues probably caused it. This probably won't change in the next books.\\n\\nI remember that when I watched the movies, our heroine Katniss made a rather good impression on me as I liked her determination and the fact that she never gave up. She was a young girl who sacrificed herself for her sister in order to take part in a deadly game in which she was one of the few participants who actually had a good heart and didn’t want to go on a killing spree. In the book, as it turns out, Katniss also made a good impression on me. I liked her, I didn't love her, but maybe that will change to the latter in the next books. We'll see. Let’s also not forget about Peeta. I just loved this man. That’s it. Katniss is lucky because I can only dream that someone would feel the same way about me as Peeta feels about her. I can't wait to watch her fall in love with him because they have such a manwife & girlhusband energy. I know they are not married, I don’t even know if they will, but they do okay.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, I can’t wait to dive into the next two books. Katniss better give my lover boy a chance in them, because I don't understand how you cannot love him.\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'I started this book thinking the idea was preposterous: a government choosing to squelch rebellion by forcing its citizens to give up their children as contenders in the ultimate reality show of death to the last survivor. Yeah right, and yet it reminded me a lot of the absurdity of the Nazi party, child armies in Africa, and even back to the gladiators of the Roman empire. I realized I believed a government could be this arrogant and wrathful, that society could be this absurd, that the common people would be too afraid to fight back. When people are pitted against each other instead of turning on the establishment they often fight each other within the failed system, fighting for that elusive top spot or ignoring the pain of others grateful to escape tragedy themselves.\\n\\nI soon found myself intensely involved in the Hunger Games and hoping for a certain outcome that would certainly bring about the death of many children but save our brave heroine. Once you\\'re in, what option do you have but to play and survive? Collins did an amazing job of taking an unbelievable and predictable storyline and making it believable and unpredictable. Complete with an impossible love interest, twists in the arena to keep you guessing, and both sympathy and hatred for the other characters, the book is hard to put down. I stayed up late to reach the conclusion that would seem obvious but was still evasive when I could conceive many alternate endings. In some ways the story reminded me of Lord of the Flies, but without as frustrating of a dues ex machina ending.\\n\\nI found it interesting that even in this life and death situation, the kids refused to do anything that would displease the Capitol and make them look rebellious or unwilling to play, or worse emotional and disturbed by death. They did not bond with each other, help each other, or ever want to be indebted by anyone\\'s kindness. Sad that the gravest error would be vulnerability of spirit because the tough ones are the ones to survive. While Katniss gets out of having to do a lot of the killing, she still plays her part, and even being the cause of one death is too many. I found it interesting that they switch to survival mode and kill without thought or regret. I\\'m sure the regret and nightmares will come later, but we as the readers have to feel the sadness of the deaths now, and live with our own relief that a child died who wasn\\'t Katniss. There is obviously a lot of death hashed out, but only a handful experienced by our narrator. There is one death that is rather gruesome, but for the most part, I thought the subject matter handled appropriately for YA. Nonetheless the subject matter is not appropriate for younger children.\\n\\nMy one compliant about the novel would be the overuse of fragments. As a grammar freak, I\\'ll let powerful fragments go. On occasion. As a literary device. But you throw five and six back to back. Just for effect. And all I\\'m doing is counting. How many are going by before we\\'re back to complete sentences. There were a few paragraphs with way too many. But that\\'s just a style difference. And the story is worth it. A good tale and a thinker.\\n\\nEven after I closed this book, I found myself mulling over the statements about society, our gruesome need for reality TV, our shallow obsession with looks, how much a community will let others suffer as long as they are safe, and the strength of the human spirit when backed up against the wall. I enjoyed Katniss\\' emotionally detached character, Peeta\\'s vulnerable goodness, and Rue\\'s small but fighting spirit. Now I want to learn more about Gale. A good strong female protagonist and a great set up for the sequel which I will be reading. How will the Capital be brought down? Who will Katniss chose? Can she stand by and let another gruesome show go by training the tributes from her village without action? Can this society be saved or is it beyond redemption? I\\'m intrigued.\\n\\n\\nETA: I\\'ve been thinking a lot about the messages in the Hunger Games with all the hype for the movie. Good dystopias are warnings, something to make you mull over trends in society by making these public wrongs absurd and larger than life. Here are some of the comparisons I found between Panem and our society:\\n\\n-. The plastic surgery, the bright peacocky colors, the time and money spent primping, the obnoxious outfits that one could never work in or survive in come catastrophe. The shoes Effie Trinket wears in the movie are popular today and nobody can walk properly in them. Our obsession with looks is headed toward the unimaginable level of the Capitol. And the overindulgence doesn\\'t stop at appearances. The overeating, the mcmansions, party-the-time lifestyle. Our shallow, keeping-up-with-the Joneses society is heading there.\\n\\n-. The people of the Capitol don\\'t care where their resources come from, who works and dies for it, or how limited the supply is. They don\\'t conserve; they don\\'t say \"thank you\"; they don\\'t look beyond themselves. The degree of separation from them and their food and resources means they have no appreciation for it. It\\'s like us with our grocery stores full of already slaughtered food and the diamonds we were fought hard for in Africa. You can say the entitlement is a lesson for the 1% out there and you can say the entitlement is a lesson for the anti-1% who feel entitled for their government to support them. Even the poor in America are still better off than most of the world. We are all the 1% and the sense of entitlement from Americans could be our downfall.\\n\\n-. Reality TV, video games, gruesome movies (like the Hunger Games :) ) have desensitized us. As horrific as the Hunger Games is (not the book but the actual Games in a society), how far off are we when girls throw parties to watch other girls get their hearts broken on The Bachelor, or when we feel nothing as people starve through a month on Survivor, or break out in fights on shows on MTV. We stop shy of death, but how long before push the envelope there too? How long before a gladiator-style game becomes popular for us too? After all, we are following the footsteps of the Roman Empire. I\\'ve been reading articles on Yahoo! like crazy the past few weeks about how to do Katniss\\' braid or what food to eat in celebration of the movie release. We are as bad as the Capitol in some cases.'},\n",

Let them begin for real.”\\n\\n\\ni’ve never watched the movies. therefore i have nothing to compare it to besides the last time i read this. i will watch them eventually!\\n\\ni am so glad i got to read this book back in middle school. rereading this book gave me a sense of deja vu while reading some of the scenes. but wow my brain was really muddled while i read this. i definitely need to catch up on reading this series and find out everything before the entire series gets spoiled for me 🥲\\n\\ni thought the setting of this book was very interesting. i love the world building when it comes to dystopian books like this. my main problem with this book was how slowly the story moved sometimes and it became hard to read. however it did pique my interest with every chapter i read. it moved slow but captivated my attention in a way where i didn’t want to stop reading. it was also hard to stay motivated while reading this book, considering i was freshly out of a slump. i highly don’t recommend reading this book while in a slump.\\n\\n\\n\\ni loved the side characters, like cinna in this book. he was everything and he’s probably one of my favorites along with peeta. he was so supportive of katniss and reassured her when she needed it and truly tried his best to be there for her. i still have mixed feelings abt effie and haymitch bc they obviously can be good people but they have these bad qualities that taint their character and shape them. hopefully they have some redeeming ones in the upcoming books!!\\n\\nkatniss was the kind of character where she’s a realistic thinker and had trust issues which i believe are completely justifiable. however, her cluelessness felt like it dragged on way more than necessary after everything that peeta and her went through and i wished she got the hint earlier. i understand katniss’ trust issues with new ppl and how she was forced to hang out with peeta in the beginning but i feel so sad for peeta and how katniss was never able to sort out how she truly felt. i still loved her as a main character and i admired her determination. she was giving “you’re on your own, kid” by taylor swift vibes. the way she had to hold up her family and provide food meant that there was a lot of pressure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni wish we got more of peeta and his personality. in the beginning, i was a bit skeptical of him just like katniss. it felt as though he secretly resented katniss bc of how his mom thought she had a better survival chance than him when quite the opposite was the case in the beginning. he still absolutely carried this book and brought the entertainment. the fact that he was only known as the boy with the bread throughout the story to katniss makes me sad. i absolutely loved them together and seeing both of their sides revealed at the end of the book really provided a lot of conflicting feelings which i loved. it was heart wrenching and sad, and i am so excited to continue with this series,\\n\\ntell me why this book was so confusing? people told me there’s a love triangle but not to mention the fact that she compared him to her like a brother. so after telling everyone that she sees him like a brother it turns out he’s holding her back at the end? where does he even come from. i also didn’t like how she compared little things that peeta did to gale!! gale was such a fucking bitch from the first few pages. however i do get how she could’ve liked him based on how they became friends over the years\\n\\ni love the bond between prim and katniss. it was so sweet bc it’s clear that they cared for one another greatly and the narrative didn’t primarily focus on the sister bond. katniss was a strong fmc from the start and she made her place clear (or tried to). she was so independent and learned to do things on her own after a near death experience with her family. they were never selfish and cared it was obvious they cared about family. she didn’t think for one second about how her life was more valuable than prim’s because of how strong their love was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthere were so many cute scenes that katniss and peeta shared. one that i liked was when katniss adapted a small habit of peeta’s by dipping her rolls in hot chocolate. not to mention the way they both took care of one another when they were sick? it was so hard to not get attached to their story bc it was clear that it meant everything to peeta. he deserves the absolute world after everything that’s happened. i felt so bad knowing he was left out of the knowledge that everything was for show. that just left more sadness on his part and i think it shows how true and genuine he was through it all. i truly admire that.\\n\\nˏˋ°•*⁀➷\\nthe ballad of songbirds and snakes - tbr\\n\\ncatching fire - tbr\\nmockingjay - tbr\\n\\n\\n\\nI AM NEVER FORGIVING SUZANNE COLLINS FOR THAT ENDING. i miss my babies 😭😭 rtc'},\n",

       "    'review': \"This is probably one of the better books I've ever read.\\n\\nDespite the promise for some violence and gore, I would actually suggest it for a teenage audience and upward. The violence isn’t explicit and exists on the peripherals of what is otherwise a brilliant and captivating read.\\n\\nThe main character, Katniss, is incredible. She's strong, proud, clever, yet cold, calculating and soft. As far as great female characters go, she rivals Elizabeth Bennet and takes her thrown for my favourite ever. Where the Empress by Karen Miller was let down by a cold, calculating female character with no likeability, The Hunger Games is carried by Katniss' passion, determination and struggle.\\n\\nThe world itself seems unbelievable enough but if you can get past the concept of a government requiring a tribute of 12-18 year old boys and girls to take part in a gruesome bloodbath then you should be fine.\\n\\nThe supporting characters are rich and interesting. The world itself is three dimensional and tactile when reading and you will probably find yourself immersed in the science fiction world that doesn’t seem that distant from our own.\\n\\nThe plot and pacing never dulls and the end of the book may just cause heart palpitations as you race towards the end to discover who will survive and who will die.\\n\\nThe ending left me a little disconcerted but only because I wanted more.\"},\n",

       "    'review': '\"I want to die as myself ... I don\\'t want them to change me in there. Turn me into some kind of monster that I\\'m not.\"\\n\\nKindness is the only act against which tyranny cannot prevail. Peeta Mellark, without violence or aggression, begins a rebellion that the world of Panem could have never stopped once it began. I\\'ve read this book so many times simply because of that message. I have never felt so much fear, and so much hope all at one time. The Hunger Games is about fighting for the freedom of choice, but more, it\\'s about fighting for the freedom to love, and to live.\\n\\nFor the freedom to never fear.\\n\\nThe moment we meet Katniss, we understand what it is to survive. She hunts, and barters, and does everything she can to avoid a past that she fights to never repeat. She lives in constant fear of starvation and deprivation, her constant guide is finding a next meal. In that sense, there was not a single person more prepared to enter the games.\\n\\nTo grasp the true meaning of what it is to fight for your life, though, Katniss was the most unprepared person in Panem.\\n\\nIn every step leading up to the games, we watch Katniss fight to understand what the games are truly meant for. The obvious answers are control, fear, and punishment. She sees all of that, but she also recognizes it\\'s about distraction and hope. Distraction from self, and hope for a better future. With the promise of a life of comfort, and the constant fear of never having enough, the games provide the entire country with something to root for, and something to hate. It binds them together as much as it tears them apart.\\n\\nWhat Katniss doesn\\'t expect, is the simplicity of love. Did any of us really expect that?\\n\\nIf you have yet to set your eyes on this story, please don\\'t keep waiting.\\n\\nThe true beauty behind these stories, for me, is how kindness can truly set the world on fire when it is honest. Peeta Mellark doesn\\'t know how to be anything but.\\n\\nKatniss\\' rebellion is loud. In front of everyone, she commits the most true act of rebellion anyone could have imagined. She set a war in motion she was never ready to lead. Peeta\\'s rebellion is quiet, and respectful, and so much more dangerous. He dares to love in a world that asks him to think of nothing but his own survival. He not only dares to love, but asks the world to love with him. He doesn\\'t expect reciprocation, he only asks for the country to protect that love with their life, just as he would.\\n\\nIn the movie, President Snow states that, He mistakenly believes that Katniss is the hope of his nation, that her rebellion is what he has feared his entire life. He believes she is his end, but isn\\'t it Peeta\\'s own rebellion that gives her that power in the first place?\\n\\nPeeta is the hope of Panem, the voice of Panem, the future nobody thinks to ask for. Katniss is the symbol, the fighter, and the match. Together, they\\'re a spark that can never be doused.\\n\\nI love The Hunger Games so much simply because it shows how true bravery, true fight... it starts with one act of kindness, and a constant belief in love. When Katniss believed in that kindness, she learned to fight. When she began to recognize that love, she started a war.\\n\\nWhat is probably the most important point made in this series, alongside Peeta\\'s constant rebellion, is media perception. So like own media, it shows how influential information can be. How truth is always found in the constant lies. I so enjoy seeing the system upon which the games stand come to life. The idea of parading 24 teenagers around in costumes before they fight for their life, asking for them to show a nation who they are in only a few minutes, and testing their skill sets against their 23 competitors. It\\'s unimaginable, and yet completely believable.\\n\\nAnd this is only the beginning. If The Hunger Games is a spark, Catching Fire is the fear that spark encourages. And Mockingjay, the proof of how powerful hope truly is.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'Reread August 2024, probably my 3rd+ reread\\n\\nReread November 2022\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s been a long time since I first read The Hunger Games series. I remember loving it, and I love the films. After a movie marathon of the series on Black Friday I decided to revisit the books and it was such an amazing experience. I’ve have trouble reading physical copies of books the last six months, and I thought it was just me, but then I devoured the hardcover of this one with no problem, so hopefully I am cured.\\n\\nWe all know the story, I don’t need to rehash it. It is incredible to be that there are 7 million ratings of this book on Goodreads. It truly is a phenomenon. I read this book when it first came out, I think maybe in 2009 or 2010. I remember being so focused on the romantic relationship with Peeta, but now as an adult it was really so clear to me there wasn’t really a “romance” but just Katniss trying to survive. And I totally understood where she was coming from, we were in her head as readers and able to see her doubts and thoughts.\\n\\nI wasn’t a big reality tv watcher when I first read this book, but I have been a fan of it in recent years (especially the Real Housewives franchise) and I have to say, the reality tv aspect of this book disturbed me now more than ever before. When I was younger I thought that concept in the book was far-fetched and unbelievable. Now, it fits seamlessly with the story and I understood a lot of the decisions Katniss and Haymitch made because they knew people were watching. And it is incredibly unsettling.\\n\\nI am so glad I decided to reread this book and I will be rereading the other two as well. Catching Fire had always been my favorite, while Mockingjay was disappointing to me so I am wondering if my opinions of both of them will have changed.'},\n",

       "    'review': '“Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor.”\\n\\nIt sure feels nice writing a review after not reading a book or writing a review for over a month.\\n\\nI\\'m honestly so glad I\\'ve actually managed to finish a book and I\\'m going to try very hard to get back into my reading schedule.\\n\\nBut anyways, this is one of the first series that got me into YA, which then proceeded to get me into reading in general and I\\'m very grateful for that.\\n\\nI first read this in 6th grade and as an impressionable little child I thought that it would be too violent for me and let me tell you that some parts of this book haunt me to this day, like it wasn\\'t even terrible violence (to be fair, it probably was to 6th grade me) but some stuff still made me gag while rereading this.\\n\\nAlso, this reread was also partially to help me not fall for Young Snow in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes movie. DO NOT JUDGE OK I have a habit of falling for the bad guys if they\\'re attractive. Let\\'s just say, my problem has been fixed because Snow is disgusting and evil and I hate him.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the plot overall for this book is great, action around every corner. Once you get to the actual Hunger Games part that is. Since this is a reread, I knew when the Hunger Games portion was going to start, so I wanted so badly to just skip to that part because, although I love the outfits and Capitol stuff, I came for the Hunger Games part.\\n\\nOnce you get into the Hunger Games, the book just has a way of keeping you on the edge of your seat, always saying \"oh I wonder who\\'s going to die next\" or \"ouch that must have hurt\" or \"oh yeah that death was kind of gruesome not gonna lie\" and so forth.\\n\\nNow as for the stuff that I said traumatized me as a child:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo as for the characters, they\\'re decent enough.\\n\\nI\\'ve come to learn that disliking Katniss actually isn\\'t as rare as I thought, so I feel more comfortable with my thoughts of her.\\n\\nI really don\\'t like her. I get that she\\'s a 16 year old girl and some 16 year olds are like this, but like she annoyed me so much at some points with her whining. I feel like I can\\'t really be saying all this stuff considering all that she has been through but that still doesn\\'t excuse bad behavior. I will say, she is braver than I EVER can be. Like volunteering for the Hunger Games? I\\'d like to say that I\\'d do that but I don\\'t think I could. (Is that cold hearted to say..?)\\n\\nNow Peeta is complicated. Not now, he isn\\'t, I love Peeta now. But when I first read the book...brace yourself....I really liked Gale (IT\\'S CAUSE OF LIAM HEMSWORTH I SWEAR TO GOD). Which came with a hatred for Peeta, as that always seems to go with me and love triangles. So, when I was younger, I always got so annoyed with him and whined about him all the time because Katniss was paying attention to HIM and not GALE (I had issues I know) Now, Peeta is my lovely little bread boy and I love him <3 He\\'s so much better in the books than in the movies too, like in the movies he\\'s kind like a stale piece of bread (heh) but in the books he\\'s got a personality.\\n\\nAs for the other characters, they were all fine. Haymitch and Effie are the other notable ones too, I really liked both of them.\\n\\nDo not talk to me about any of the other tributes, especially not a certain someone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is where my unswayable opinions came in when I was in 6th grade. I was HARDCORE team Gale, and honestly kind of ashamed of it too after seeing all the Gale slander around, but nothing ever changed my mind because \"oH my GOSH Liam Hemsworth is soooo attractive.\"\\n\\nNow, I\\'m obviously team Everlark like no questions asked. I also feel like if I was brave enough to say I was team Gale whatever their ship name is, I\\'d get attacked (I swear I\\'m not) Katniss doesn\\'t deserve Peeta, but no one deserves Peeta because Peeta deserves the entire universe.\\n\\nThank you 😌\\n\\n\\n\\nSo anywho, I love this series and if you haven\\'t yet somehow read this series yet, I\\'d highly recommend it! Thank you for reading this review and happy reading! *insert outro music here*\\n\\n4 stars\\n\\n\\n\\nHaymitch is an icon.\\n\\n(PS: if you cringed at all in this review PLEASE tell me because I overthink way too much about my jokes and I swear I\\'ll delete the ones that are cringy)\\n\\n<><><><><><><>\\nthe nostalgia I feel with this reread is unreal.\\n\\nrtc since I didn\\'t write one the first time I read this'},\n",

So I think I won’t be as active as I usually was. But I still usually check Goodreads a couple of times in a week!\\n\\nI actually have finished reading this book back in December 2019. But I didn’t have the time to review it until now. So here’s what I think of this book!\\n\\nI still remember years ago while I was in junior high school and I watched the movie adaptation of this book. I still remember how I loved it and my adrenaline was pumped throughout the movie and LUCKLY, I barely remember anything when I started to read this book nearly a month ago. It was not as amazing as I expected, BUT it wasn’t bad either. It was good actually. But not amazing.\\n\\nThe plot was honestly so intriguing. It was slow, but it wasn’t necessarily boring. But I would be happy, if the pacing of the book were much faster and this comes from a person who loves slow-paced books. But when the actions began. Wow. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time. It didn’t take me any effort to be engrossed in reading it. I followed Katniss’ adventure and it was both EXCITING and TERRIFYING. But unfortunately, I can’t say the same for the characters.\\n\\nI wanted to love the characters. To adore them or at least like them. However, the truth is, I don’t love them or hate them. I wasn’t really excited about Katniss or Petta. I didn’t form any kind of attachment to any of them. It was a bit frustrating because I wanted to be connected to them. But no. I didn’t feel anything for them. And the romance? I honestly don’t know what to say about it. Like totally at lost of words right now. The only thing that kept me going in reading the book instead of DNF-ing it was just the plot. It was thrilling. I don’t think I’ll read the sequels. I just don’t feel like I want to spend my time reading them. But anyway, it wasn’t entirely a bad book.\\n\\nIf you haven’t read this book, and you’re curious about it. I guess you should give it a try? It’s not the worst book I’ve ever read, but it wasn’t such a splendid book either. It was okay. Good enough.\\n\\n❤️😊\\n\\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\\nI’m reading this book for the first time! I watched the movie adaptation years ago, but fortunately I remember NOTHING! YAY! Hopefully, I’ll enjoy reading it.\\n\\nHave you read this book? Did you like it? (No spoiler!) 😊'},\n",

And as a fully formed adult, I still adore this book. It might hit even harder now than it did then.\\n\\nThe way YA used to be gruesome and dystopian. I ate it up and I love that I can eat it up all over again years and years later.\\n\\nKids were getting murdered in this book. It\\'s not fade-to-black. Teens have their throat\\'s slit, are blown to bits by jury-rigged explosives, poisoned, choked, stabbed, beaten, and much more. I\\'m amazed that this keeps it\\'s youthful air while also maintaining a truly horrifying atmosphere.\\n\\nThe juxtaposition this dystopia has with our world\\'s consumerism, capitalism and patriarchy is beyond words. Suzanne Collins wrote a very realistic look at where our society could end up. And how to circumvent it. If this was written today, it would have the same impact it did in 2008. It truly stands the test of time.\\n\\nHOWEVER, I do want to mention 2 things that felt very problematic to me. If these 2 things hadn\\'t happened, it would be a perfect 5 star book for me.\\n\\nFirst, District 11 is largely a Black community. They\\'re based in agriculture. They spend sun up to sun down harvesting crops, gathering fruits and vegetables. None of which they\\'re allowed to eat mind you. They sing songs to pass the time and communicate with each other because they aren\\'t allowed to conversate during working hours. They\\'re whipped if they step out of line. Okay! Just say they\\'re picking cotton. Just SAY that they\\'re slaves. You\\'re not being discrete. You\\'re not doing something new. I don\\'t understand why you had to take a Black District and make it slave-topia when the entire idea of the \\'Districts\\' is to breed slave mentality. Why not have any other District talk about getting whipped?? Why not have any other District have singing communal songs a part of their history? Why not have any other District punished for partaking in what they\\'re producing. I don\\'t know. Maybe I\\'m just on a tangent. But it felt really uncool to me.\\n\\nSecond, I hate the romance. Why have it in the first place? I hope that the publicist asked her to include it for audience retention. I hope Suzanne Collins was against it. Because Katniss Everdeen is an asexual, aromantic girlie and I won\\'t discuss conversations otherwise. She never feels any desire toward Gale nor Peeta. She feels a kinship toward them. Especially with Gale who she\\'s been a ride-or-die for for what feels like forever. But she constantly thinks \"I love him but do I like him like that? I don\\'t know. What does that feel like?\" and when thinking of Peeta in the Games, she keeps thinking \"I don\\'t like him like that but I don\\'t want to die and the Sponsors are wanting us to be this epic love story, so I should go along with it. And, hell, maybe that\\'s how love starts. I\\'ll try it out\". That is EXACTLY how young asexual/aromantic people feel before they\\'ve discovered their identities. Coming from one myself, I identified with Katniss a lot in this book and can\\'t see her any other way now.\\n\\nI think Peeta played the game very well. Making the audience fall in love with them as a couple is brilliant game maneuvering. But it being real? Not a chance. I don\\'t buy it. And I don\\'t want to see any more of it. I know the other books have that as a heavy plot point and I\\'m disappointed to know that going into them. But I know I loved the series overall. So I\\'ll definitely be continuing in my reread over the next few months.'},\n",

It was interesting, no doubt, but I have some issues with this. (Side note that this is the first time I\\'m reading the books and have yet to watch the movies.)\\n\\nFirst of all, there\\'s the writing itself. It isn\\'t anything particularly special - it does its job of telling the story fairly well, without adding much embellishment . But, I felt that as a result, the characters weren\\'t very well-developed either. I mean, sure, they\\'re nice to read about (who doesn\\'t want to read about a bunch of kids in a televised death match) but they didn\\'t give me a sense of realism or 3-dimensional-ness.\\n\\nThe first half of this book is actually quite promising and very intriguing. Although I got Divergent vibes from the first couple of pages (this is a very bad thing if you know me), I actually enjoyed it. The last third, on the other hand, just wasn\\'t great. Where the first two-thirds of the book was fast-paced and interesting, the last third was mostly just Katniss and Peeta making out \"for the sake of the audience\".\\n\\n*snorts*\\n\\nRiiight. Definitely.\\n\\nMy favorite character was probably either Haymitch or Rue. Katniss is alright, if very dense, and Peeta is incredibly soft (eh). Effie was charming but amusing, but I think things might change if Prim is more prominent in the next book. We\\'ll see how this all plays out.\\n\\nI\\'m still invested enough in this story to genuinely want to read the next book, not to mention, I think I know the outcome of the love triangle (I have refused to spoil it for myself thus far).\\n\\nAll in all, there\\'s only one takeaway from this review: whY THE FORK IS THE \"S\" ON THE COVER IN A DIFFERENT FONT THAN THE REST OF \"THE HUNGER GAME\"??

       "    'review': 'Seriously, don\\'t read this review if you haven\\'t read the books.\\n\\nThe biggest compliment I can think to give an 870 page book is that I wish it had been longer. I wish this had been longer.\\n\\nThis book has always been my favorite in the series. Up until it, Harry’s story had been filled with light. Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it\\'s true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. Ron got over his jealousy, the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion, and good still triumphed over evil. Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort, yet again, and warn the wizarding world of his return.\\n\\nAnd then\\n\\nThe beginning of this book hits you in the face. Where you expect Harry to be in the know, he’s in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, there’s only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. And you know what? You get it, you frigging get it, man.\\n\\nBecause you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone, you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemy’s wand and helped save his life. And when he made it back to safety, you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him, refused to believe Dumbledore.\\n\\nSo how dare they? How dare they let him rot, alone, in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him, while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? How dare they feed him snippets like “We can’t tell you anything about what we’ve been doing, and we’ve been doing A LOT. But don’t worry, we’ll see you soon, we just can’t tell you when”? As if he hasn’t been through enough. If anyone has the right to know what’s going on, it’s Harry. Doesn’t anyone KNOW him like we do? Or do they just think that they know what’s best for him better than he does?\\n\\nAnd that’s part of the genius of this installment. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as children’s stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a child’s mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings. This book teaches you that adults aren’t the perfect protectors you thought they were. Sirius isn’t infallible. James Potter isn’t infallible. Albus frigging Dumbledore isn’t infallible. None of them are. None of them are even fully good. And come to find out, those you thought were fully evil might not be either. This book introduces you to shades of grey, and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last.\\n\\nNormally, I hate angst. This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. Trying to cover up weak characterization? Add some angst! Want to hide those holes in your plot? Add some angst!\\n\\nThe only type of angst I can stand is believable angst. Rowling delivers on this. And that’s one of the many reasons that I love this book. There are a lot of other reasons, Fred and George’s badassery, Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right, the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge, the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger, the loyalty of Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom coming into his own, the failed Occlumency lessons (I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministry’s interference.\\n\\nI even loved the ending. YES, I SAID IT! And do you know why? Because life isn’t sunshine and roses and you don’t always get to say goodbye to those you love. You don’t get the sense that Sirius’s death was a righteous one. You don’t get resolution. He didn’t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. He died taunting the bad guys, smiling at them, egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. And then you find out that it was all for nothing. That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. How do you deal with that? The best you can, I guess.\\n\\nSo while I don’t necessarily \"enjoy\" this book as much as I do the others, it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above.'},\n",

This Lord Voldything\\'s back, you say.\"\\n\\nWhen a book gets too long, there\\'s always the risk of giving up halfway, or start skimming through parts. I think, The Order of Phoenix qualifies as long (the version I read had around a 1000 pages), but I wish it to be even longer. Only Rowling can do that. I didn\\'t find one boring bit, or anything out of place. We are reaching a near-perfect level of writing here at the fifth of the series, which, in my opinion, is an excellent concoction of suspense, hope, triumph, disappointment, humor, anger, happiness, sadness and so many others.\\n\\n\\n\\nRight from the beginning, you\\'ll find everything to be intriguing as always, with an excellent set of new characters being introduced. The main characters around Harry are of course the main focus, and the narration inherits a lot from how the teenage Harry views the world. Average emotional rollercoaster of a teenager blends in nicely with the main plot, and makes things more interesting.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe\\'ve finally moved in to the core of the story, and an-action-packed story is being unfolded - full of dark times - with no more holding back. If it wasn\\'t for Rowling\\'s writing, this might\\'ve felt like one complex story, not to mention how unbearable it would\\'ve been with Umbrige, and also with Lestrange and Fudge closely behind. But everything\\'s put in place perfectly, and even the annoying characters do their part really well. And the ending chapters - though disappointing - are the best and most dramatic in the series so far. This has been one amazing ride, while proving the \\'Last-is-Best\\' still to be true.'},\n",

Harry and Sirius- they never had much time together but the time they did have really influenced Harry’s development, a few wise words from a sincere friend (or godfather) can go a real long way. And this scene was perhaps the most powerfully written in the series for me, we all know what happens next:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry, Ron and Hermione have always taken matters into their own hands; they’ve never waited for someone to come along and save them. And here they have got so many great characters involved in their heroics, which leads me onto my next point.\\n\\n\\n\\nbecause the weird people are always the best people. Luna’s by far my favourite character because she is so completely herself in all her colourfulness; she’s often ignored, avoided and even ridiculed as a result but secretly she is brilliant.

And I plan to tell you exactly why the fuck why.\\n\\nOrder of the Pheonix is the most emotional book of the entire series, in a lot of ways. You have the visit to Neville's parents, Harry's ending breakdown as a character, the backstory behind Snape and Sirius... It deals with the deep emotional stuff in a way that the first few books didn't, with the possible exception of Prisoner of Azkaban.\\n\\n\\n\\nHarry is an incredibly traumatized young adult who's just been isolated from every person who cares about him all summer. Literally every single person who cares about him. You try being dropped in that situation and not being upset, especially as a fifteen-year-old. But what really stands out here is Harry's character arc as he comes to be less angsty. This book took him to his bottom point and to his top and it's brilliant.\\n\\n\\n\\nJ.K. Rowling really nails down her tonal shifts in this book. The darker tone really takes this series to the next level in terms of plot AND character work. It's about resisting oppression in any way you can and it's just a perfect fucking book god I love this book so much\\n\\nThe plotting is brilliant, incorporating one of the most terrifying villains I have ever read about in my entire life. She's so and that's what makes her such a terrifying character. Also, the plot reveals at the end. The interesting twist on the chosen one trope in regards to Neville.\\n\\nThe side characters and the entire concept of the DA and their bonding as a team really stand out here. This book also deals with the fact that adults aren't perfect, even when they love you and want to help you. Also, Ginny Weasley is fucking perfect. Why do all of you sleep on her verbal DRAG of Harry? “I forgo–” “LUCKY YOU”\\n\\nThis book is also undoubtedly the funniest of the series. Fred and George. The school resistance to Umbridge. I don't know, maybe Lord Voldemort? IT UNSCREWS THE OTHER WAY.\\n\\nThis book is just fucking perfect. My mother is giving me annoyed looks while reading this review on her goodreads app but I don't care, this book is perfect.\"},\n",

This book became my favourite after my long distance with Harry Potter (2014?). & I totally love it right now! (though I loved it before too, but that Umbridge made me sooooooooo angryyyy! & 4 & 2 are still my top favourites. but this one also been added at the top of the list.)\\n\\nProbably the Darkest time at Hogwarts. Harry had hard times (from the first to the last) in different sort of ways; angry, under pressure, self-struggling, mad, sad. I understood how he felt; I was angry with him, at the ministry's reaction & how they treated him after all he'd been through, it was not fair. But he stood up for what was right, the truth, not the sweet lies, or what was easy; even if he would be punished. He didn't back away from his words, just because those idiots didn't like it. (that's why I like the heroes; strong, brave, standing up for what is right)\\nI was sad with him. My heart was broken for him.\\n\\nthe World's getting darker . more pressure on Harry.

I'm pretty sure we all do. beside walking in those spectacular corridors, eating in the Great Hall, exploring the castle & wandering on the grounds, all those interesting magical lessons.\\nMany secrets revealed through this book for us & for the characters.\\njust 'the hearing' parts was a bit dull, but re-reading in many years of being a potterhead, made me start to like it. (& by the whole fascinating & breathtaking plot, I could easily ignore that.)\\n\\n-\\nwhy this book is my favorite too, in details:\\n🟇 the humor in the first chapters, made by Sassy Harry.

It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened. This book could've easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J.K. Rowling got rid of all the pointless details and chapters that added nothing significant to the storyline. The movie was never really one of my favorites either and that was probably the primary reason it took me more than a month to get through Order of the Phoenix.\\n\\nOn top of that, I wasn't a big fan of Harry in this book. I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98% of the time and although I can empathize with him, it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast. He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying. All the constant CAPITALIZED yelling didn't help too much either.\\n\\nEven though Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite movie and book, I LOVED the concept of Dumbledore's Army. I just loved seeing all the students in action and actually putting everything they learned into good use. We finally get to meet Luna Lovegood, one of my favorite Harry Potter characters of all time, and I was so ecstatic every time her name was mentioned.\\n\\nAs for Umbridge, she was also the ultimate villain in this book. She was the woman you LOVED to HATE and I felt the movie nailed this portrayal so perfectly. If J.K. Rowling's goal was to make you want to rip your own hair to shreds, she succeeded that and more.\\n\\nOverall, I felt the book was unnecessarily long but the movie itself was not much better. Where the book felt too slow, the film adaptation felt too rushed leaving out key details. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series, but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books.\"},\n",

I know it's not fair to compare, but because the film version of Order of the Phoenix isn't one of my favorites, coupled with the fact that this is the longest novel in the series, I was really nervous to get to this one. Obviously I was a muggle fool who deserves to be chased around by Peeves for a full 24 hours, because this was such a vital installment that really breathed a mature life into the series. The ending of Goblet of Fire is quite dark, but I felt book #5 is where the series really gets down to business and loses the childlike innocence that it clasped tightly for some long. What a brilliant, hauntingly beautiful way to write a series that grows as the reader does. Only two more to go, which makes me quite sad, but also excited to find out how they compare to the rest!\"},\n",

It is saved only by the virtue that it is a Harry Potter book and moves the series along to the still yet unknown finale.\\nMy issues with it:\\n- deals with complex social/political problems in a simplified, extreme, and dichotomous manner\\n- characterisations are too easy/lazy- all good or all bad (with the exception of Snape who\\'s good/evil intentions are yet unknown), all courageous or cowardly, the righteous or the corrupt.\\n- Malfoy junior is the most incompetent nemesis in the history of evil. And whilst this was acceptable in the earlier books where there was an element of the comical in his attempts to be evil, by book 5, where the themes have become signifantly darker, he and his side-kicks\\' unchanging and inane attempts to foil Harry\\'s ultimate fate have just become annoying. The only is that Harry has more than enough true and worthwhile enemies and obstacles for the reader to really get bogged down by Malfoy\\'s silliness.\\n- the laudable themes of power/corruption/propaganda/censorship are played out with such naive characterisations, extreme situations and melodramaticism that it results in inflammatory knee-jerk reactions rather than furthering understanding of the subleties of these ideas.\\n- the plot seems confused, as if JK Rowling has all these ideas, but is unsure of where she ultimately wants to go, thereby leaving in all these subplots that neither has entertainment, wisdom nor story-advancing value. EG what\\'s with Grawp and the freaking giants??\\n\\nOverall- read it only as a part of the greater goal of coming closer to the ending of the series.'},\n",

Rowling\\n\\nThe novel was published on 21 June 2003 by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix follows Harry Potter\\'s struggles through his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, including the surreptitious return of the antagonist Lord Voldemort, O.W.L. exams, and an obstructive Ministry of Magic.\\n\\nDuring the summer, Harry Potter and his cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors. Forced to use magic to fend them off, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, but his expulsion is postponed pending a hearing at the Ministry of Magic.\\n\\nHarry is whisked off to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the childhood home of Sirius Black, by a group of wizards belonging to the Order of the Phoenix.\\n\\nRon Weasley and Hermione Granger explain that the Order is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters.\\n\\nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny Weasley and Fred and George Weasley learn that Voldemort is seeking something he lacked prior to his defeat.\\n\\nThe Ministry, led by Cornelius Fudge, refuses to accept Voldemort\\'s return, and are running a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore. At the hearing, Dumbledore defends Harry, who is cleared of all charges.\\n\\nAt Hogwarts, Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry employee, becomes the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.\\n\\nShe refuses to believe in Voldemort\\'s return, and clashes with Harry, punishing him by having him magically carve \"I must not tell lies\" into the back of his hand.\\n\\nShe also refuses to teach her students how to perform defensive magic, prompting Harry, Ron, and Hermione to form their own Defence group with other students.\\n\\nUmbridge, empowered by the Ministry to interfere in Hogwarts as the new High Inquisitor, bans unapproved clubs, forcing the group, now called Dumbledore\\'s Army, to meet in secret in the Room of Requirement to practice under Harry\\'s instruction. ...\\n\\nعنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «هری پاتر و فرمان ققنوس»؛ «هری پاتر و محفل ققنوس»؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش در ماه دسامبر سال2003میلادی\\n\\nکتاب پنجم «هری پاتر و فرمان ققنوس» از سری «هری پاتر»، که با ترجمه ی جناب آقای «فریدون قاضی زاده» و سرکار خانم «نفیسه ی سلطانی»، با ویرایش سرکار خانم «نسیم عزیزی» در872صفحه، و با چهار تابلوی رنگی از هنرپیشه های فیلم، توسط نشر روزگار، با جلد شمیز چاپ شده است، قیمت کتاب با جلد شمیز50000ریال، همین کتاب، با عنوان «هری پاتر و محفل ققنوس» در سه جلد با ترجمه ی سرکار خانم «ویدا اسلامیه»، با جلد گالینگور، توسط کتابسرای تندیس نیز، چاپ و منتشر شده است؛ قیمت سه جلد جمعا98000ریال است؛ دو ترجمه را مقایسه کردم، هر دو ترجمه خوب بودند، رقابتی بیهوده بر��ی ...؛ اگر در یکی از برگردانها اشکالی بود، باز میشد، خود را به کوچه ی دیگری رساند\\n\\nپنجمین کتاب از مجموعه ی داستان\\u200cهای هفت گانه ی «هری پاتر»؛ نوشتهٔ سرکار بانو «جی.کی رولینگ» است؛ این کتاب طولانی\\u200cترین رمان این سری است، و نسخه ی «آمریکایی» آن در870صفحه، و ترجمه فارسی بانو «ویدا اسلامیه» نزدیک به1250صفحه است؛ ماجرای این رمان، پس از بازگشت «لرد سیاه» روی می\\u200cدهد؛ جمعی از جادوگران، گروهی را به ریاست «آلبوس دامبلدور»، با نام «محفل ققنوس» تشکیل میدهند، تا برای مبارزه با «ولدمورت» آماده شوند؛ این کتاب یکی از سیاه\\u200cترین، و تلخ\\u200cترین ماجراهای «هری پاتر» است؛\\n\\n\\n\\nدر پایان کتاب، «رولینگ»، خوانشگرانش را، با سازمان اسرار آشنا می\\u200cسازد؛ که بسیار شگفت انگیز است؛ در وزارت سحر و جادو، نبرد اعجاب آوری بین «لرد ولدمورت» و «آلبوس دامبلدور»، روی می\\u200cدهد؛ و سرانجام خوانشگران درمی\\u200cیابند، که «ولدمورت»، برای پیشگیری از پیشگویی، که «سیبل تریلانی (یکی از استادان پیشگویی مدرسه هاگوارتز)» در آن اعلام کرده بود، که تنها کسیکه می\\u200cتواند «ولدمورت» را، شکستی ابدی بدهد، در واپسین روز ماه «ژوئیه» به دنیا میآید، و پدر و مادر این پسر، پیش\\u200cتر، سه بار در برابر «ولدمورت» ایستادگی کرده\\u200c اند؛ در این داستان «دلورس آمبریج»، که از وزارت سحر و جادو، برای تدریس درس «دفاع در برابر جادوی سیاه»، در مدرسه «هاگوارتز» برگزیده شده\\u200c، رفته رفته از سوی وزارت سحر و جادو، رتبه\\u200c اش بالاتر می\\u200cرود؛ او قوانین دشواری در مدرسه برقرار می\\u200cکند؛ او به عنوان تنبیه، «هری پاتر» را وادار می\\u200cکند، که با خون خودش، روی دستش حک کند، که: «من نباید دروغ بگویم»؛ در اواخر داستان، «فرد» و «جرج ویزلی»، از مدرسه جادوگری «هاگوارتز»، فرار می\\u200cکنند، و با این فرار، نام خود را زبانزد خاص و عام می\\u200cکنند؛ در این شماره از مجموعه داستان\\u200cهای «هری پاتر»، نگهبان مدرسه «هاگوارتز»، «هاگرید»، با خانم «ماکسیم»، به ماموریتی، برای صلح، میان غولها به سفر می\\u200cروند، و با «گراوپ»، برادر «هاگرید» که غول است، حتی نمی\\u200cتواند به زبان انسان\\u200cها سخن بگوید، برمی\\u200cگردند؛ «هاگرید» از «هری»، و «هرمیون (هرماینی)» درخواست می\\u200cکند، که به برادرش الفبا را، یاد بدهند؛ در پایان داستان، «بلاتریکس لسترنج»، پدر خوانده ی «هری»، یعنی «سیریوس بلک» را، به قتل می\\u200cرساند، «آلبوس دامبلدور» نیز، با «لرد ولدمورت»، در وزارت سحر و جادو، درگیر می\\u200cشوند و میجنگند؛\\n\\nنقل متن از کتاب دوم برگردان خانم «ویدا اسلامیه»: (ماه دسامبر که از راه رسید، برف بیش\\u200cتری به همراه داشت، و بهمنی از تکالیف، برای دانش آموزان سال پنجمی، به ارمغان آورد؛ با نزدیک شدن «کریسمس»، وظایف ارشدی «رون»، و «هرمیون» سنگین\\u200cتر می\\u200cشد؛ به آن\\u200cها گفته بودند، که بر تزیین قلعه، نظارت کنند (رون می\\u200cگفت: «درست موقعی که آدم می\\u200cخواد ریسه \\u200cهای پرزرق\\u200cوبرق رو ببنده، بدعنق یه سر دیگه شو می\\u200cگیره، و می\\u200cخواد با اون آدمو خفه کنه.»)، و مراقب باشند تا دانش آموزان سال اوّل و دوم، زنگ تفریحشان را در قلعه بگذرانند، چرا که هوا سرد و سوز دار بود (رون می\\u200cگفت: «نمی\\u200cدونی چه بچه پرروهایی هستن، کی ما وقتی کلاس اول بودیم، اينقدر رومون زیاد بودا») و به نوبت با «آرگوس فیلچ»، در راهروها سرکشی کنند، زیرا «فیلچ» تصور می\\u200cکرد، ممکن است، حال و هوای تعطیلات باعث شود، بچه\\u200c ها با هم دوئل کنند (رون با خشم گفته بود: «توی کلّه\\u200cش به جای مغز، پهنه!»)؛ کارشان آنقدر زیاد بود، که «هرمیون» بافتن کلاه، برای جن\\u200cهای خانگی را، کنار گذاشته بود، و غرغر می\\u200cکرد، که فقط سه کلاه دیگر برایش مانده است.)؛ پایان نقل\\n\\nتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 22/12/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 26/09/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی'},\n",

       "    'review': 'Me: Okay, I’m not going to have ANY time to read for the next two weeks, and I’m close to falling behind on my reading goal, so I should be careful what I pick up.\\n\\nMe to me: 870 pages sounds about right.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI don’t even know if I can write a cohesive review of this. I’ve been reading it for SO LONG. The notes I took at the beginning have long since disappeared and I just can’t remember vast swaths of this book. This might be a review of the last 200 pages.\\n\\n\\n\\nOkay, the extreme Ravenclaw in me is coming out here - WHY DON’T HARRY AND RON EVER DO THEIR HOMEWORK? I swear to God the sub-plotline in the middle of every single book is them falling behind in their classes, and it Get on top of your work!\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd then every once in awhile, the stakes will be way higher...and these boys still apply the same procrastination to it. It happened in Goblet of Fire, when Harry would put off working on the task hints - WAY MORE IMPORTANT THAN DIVINATION DREAM CHARTS. And it happened in this book, when Harry just...didn’t try at Occlumency. I know you don’t like Snape, kid. Neither do I. In fact, my list of notes for my anti-Snape rant just kept growing through this book. BUT IT’S FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF COUNTLESS OTHERS! PEOPLE YOU LOVE!\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd poor Ron in this book, right? He finally gets good at Quidditch - good at - and there’s no one there to see him. His brothers leave him at school. Harry just...freaks out at him sometimes. Things are always rough for poor unappreciated Ron, but this is particularly tragic. And don’t even get me STARTED on Neville in this book. The Gryffindor in him really comes out. His life is so hard, and he is still so brave and loving. Oh my God, I’m legitimately getting choked up.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, not actually. But as close as I get. And disclaimer, 25 percent of that sadness is because “Audition (The Fools Who Dream)” just came up on my Spotify and LA LA LAND IS AN EMOTIONAL FILM.\\n\\n\\n\\nRating this book is going to be a struggle. I didn’t enjoy the first 600 pages, like, at all. And then I goddamn loved the last 200. Oh god. Now I have to both delineate why the first 600 pages - which I can barely remember - were bad, while the last 200 were good.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlright, I’ll try to do this quickly because clearly I’m ramble-y tonight. The first 600 pages were a terrible combination of boring AND upsetting. I’m still surprised by how Grimmauld Place managed to be such a snoozefest. A secret rebel order of wizards inhabiting a hidden house filled with dangerous relics manages to make me doze off? Unreal. Then we have to watch as a world we all hold dear is torn apart by terrible leadership - Umbridge, yes, but I also think we don’t discuss Minister of Magic Fudge’s incompetency enough.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs if that weren’t enough, all these fabulous characters we know and love are at their WORST in this book. I won’t go off on Snape yet, but I’ll explain for the others. Harry is a massive brat throughout. Hermione, my absolute fave, is a bad friend, pretentious and untrusting the whole time. Hagrid has his head particularly shoved up his ass. Dumbledore acts like an idiot, a self-admitted idiot. And Sirius ruins himself for me in this book. When he says, “You’re less like your father than I thought [...] The risk would’ve been what made it fun for James,” he is shaming a fifteen year old, guilting him into acting against his own interest and safety by bringing up his DEAD FATHER. Disgusting.\\n\\n\\n\\nDON’T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE JAMES FLASHBACK. Lupin and Sirius’s speech to Harry on it? Seriously. Lacking. James and Lily should never have ended up together, never. I get why Sirius and James were so close. THEY BOTH SUCK. But there were bright sides. Neville and Ginny are absolutely fantastic in this book, and did their best to rescue it from itself. But Luna is eh for me. I just don’t care about her. AND WE LOSE FRED AND GEORGE. I didn’t realize how much I loved their hijinks until they ruckus’d their way out of Hogwarts.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut if the first 600 pages were one, one and a half stars, the last 200 were four and a half or five. I love the setting of the Department of Mysteries, I loved that big Death Eaters battle scene. I sort of liked Dumbledore’s speech, but still was kind of like...okay buddy, you should know what the Right Thing is. Most importantly, I felt like Harry’s mourning at the end was really well captured. Which is, you know, not an impression I get often from these books. (The Harry Potter series isn’t renowned for, like, its capturing of the human experience.) And that last moment at the train station? Where all of Harry’s loved ones are defending him? Killed. Me.\\n\\n\\n\\nBottom line: I don’t know what to rate this, so I’ll give it that old placeholder, three stars. Not my favorite Harry Potter book, but featuring some of my favorite moments...alongside some of my least favorite.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'This is my favorite installment of the quintessential modern bildungsroman. Nevertheless, it has its problems, familiar to any reader of Rowling\\'s.\\n\\nShe never seems to gain control of her writing, which spirals out into thousand-page doorstops filled with unimportant side characters and rambling plots. The story is moved along by arbitrary plot devices, often magic. Instead of using the magic to make her world seem more strange and wondrous, she uses it to cover up plot holes. Why write a consistent plot when you can just put in a spell or two to fix the problems?\\n\\nLikewise her world is poorly defined. She did not start by constructing the \\'wizarding world\\' and then base her stories off of it, rather she changes her setting to fit whatever she needs at the moment. This constantly shifting setting means the world doesn\\'t make much sense if you take the time to sit and think about it.\\n\\nHer fractured plots are not the result of \\'realism\\', which some authors use to create a sense of a \\'real world\\', separate from archetypes. Rowling is just trying to fit in all the disparate ideas and characters she has in her notepad. She becomes so attached to her characters and ideas that she is unwilling to sacrifice them for a more streamlined book.\\n\\nShe has problems connecting the many dots of her story, but uses her magical \\'plot devices\\' to keep us from noticing that the scaffolding behind the facade is rather bare (indeed: crumbly). Her rabid plot movement points away from the cracks in her storytelling: \"move along, nothing to see here\".\\n\\nI find it somewhat ironic that Rowling wants to \\'graduate\\' from Potter to writing adult mysteries. A mystery needs to have a tight plot, based not in the characters but in the events surrounding them. Though many people tried to \\'figure out\\' the Potter books and predict them, in truth there is nothing to figure out.\\n\\nRowling\\'s foreshadowing is vague and unsupported, and there are just as many clues as red herrings. The only reason some of the elements seem predictable is because there was a crack team of several million people making every guess under the sun.\\n\\nCombine that with the fact that the final book introduces completely new elements to finish the plot, and we can see that Rowling is not really in charge of her own pen. She is a slave to her own sentimentality. Then again, so are millions around the world.\\n\\nThe only thing which makes these meandering plots move along at a reasonable pace are her characters. They connect us to the magical world, so that even if it doesn\\'t make sense, at least we can see how it might work for the people who live in it.\\n\\nHer characters are vivid, emotional, motivated, and archetypal without being banal. They may not be psychologically deep, but for a monomyth like this, that is hardly the point. Most people aren\\'t that complex, either.\\n\\nIn the series, this book gets the prize for the most psychological depth and also the most consistent mood. Before this, Rowling was still trying to get her footing, figuring out what exactly she was writing, and trying to explain the world to her readers.\\n\\nShe finally hit her stride in \\'Prisoner of Azkaban\\', and got much of her unsure world-building out of the way in \\'Goblet of Fire\\'. This is before she started feeling the pressure to wrap things up in a neat package, which again begins to take its toll on her consistency. This is the first, and really the last of her books where Rowling is able to write without being overly concerned with either the beginning or ending of her series.\\n\\nInstead of placing a scattered plot over her characters, Rowling was instead able to let the characters travel through their own path of growth and self-exploration. The change is the most apparent in Harry himself, and though his transformation is somewhat sudden, it is still honest and believable for the character.\\n\\nBy focusing chiefly on her strength--character building--and escaping the constraints of the monomyth, if only for a moment, Rowling is able to avoid her weakest points as a writer and turn out her strongest book.'},\n",

Her storytelling is the perfect blend of humor, sadness, suspense and pretty much everything else that makes a good book, and it's going to be something I will highly miss once I finish this wonderful series.\\n\\nOne might think that the fifth book in a series doesn't bring much new stuff to the overall plot and might even just be written to prolong the finale, but this is not the case here. The story that gets told helps to establish and develop so many things - no book of the series has been a filler so far!\\nDespite the book being so long (my copy has 800 pages), no line is boring or unnecessary. I didn't even feel like I read so many pages, because it was so entertaining.\\n\\nLike in my review of , I need to praise the portrayal of friendship! These characters are just normal teenagers with normal conflicts and fights, and I'm so happy that (besides all the fantastical elements) these ordinary things find a place in the story as well.

But as least he has the support of his good friends, Ron and Hermione.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Ministry of Magic has taken it upon themselves to make sure Harry and Dumbledore don't spread more ‘lies’ about the return of Voldemort.

But then (during a summer holiday where it was the only book I had with me) I read it multiple times after that and quickly started to see its brilliance.\\n\\nI think this book is underrated. I know many people hate this one because of Harry's outbursts and moods. I however thought Order of the Phoenix was one of the best of those reasons. It would have been unrealistic if Harry was normal after his experience in the graveyard and after Cedric's death. And also people tend to complain that YA characters are unrealistic but then are irritated when they're moody. Make up your minds!\\n\\nMy favourite scenes were the ones spent in the Room of Requirement. I just loved everything about the DA. I think Harry would be an amazing Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.\\n\\nUmbridge will always be that one character I hate above everyone else. She is the most despicable person and I hate her even more than Voldemort.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJust the thought of the end of this book fills me with sadness. Poor Harry just can't catch a break. Throughout this whole book he has to deal with people treating him like crap and being told he is a liar and an attention seeker. And then on top of that\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis book was probably one of the first times I'd read about mental illness, as I was 12/13 when I read it.

Rowling decided to be ableist in her new book, specifically in regards to people with POTS and since I have POTS, please also consider donating to this nonprofit:\\n\\nJ.K. Rowling needs to stop being hateful toward minority groups. I’ve already had my childhood ruined enough by her hatefulness.\\n\\nNow onto my review…\\n\\nTimes read: 4\\n\\nThis used to be my favorite in the series but it’s unfortunately fallen down my ranking a little bit. I still love it but there’s one particular problematic thing that irritates me (I’ll address it later in my review) and there’s Umbridge. Movie Umbridge is fun… book Umbridge makes me want to rip out my hair.\\n\\nThere’s four major reasons why I love this book so much.\\n\\nFirst of all, Fred and George have really fun scenes in this book. From the fireworks to the swamp, each of their scenes in this book are a delight to read. Lee got in on the action, too, with his little magical beast prank.\\n\\nSecondly, Dumbledore’s Army has always been epic. It’s the perfect way to rebel against a terrible leader and it’s so empowering to read about the D.A.\\n\\nThird, that fight scene at the end will always be the best fight scene in any book. It’s so different from the movie but it’s so fun. There’s so much creativity (and surprisingly some humor, too) shoved into that scene. The end result is heartbreaking, but I wish that the fight scene could forever play in a loop in my mind. It would keep me forever entertained.\\n\\nAnd finally, this book handles the topic of grief really beautifully. In four chapters, this book manages to capture all the way that grief presents itself. It covers denial, depression, and healing with all the stages in between. It’s so hard to read Harry go through it but it’s so well done. It hit a little harder for me during this reread since my dog is slowly going through kidney failure right now and I know that I will be feeling like Harry once my dog’s body can’t fight anymore. I’m crying even writing this because dang, I really understand Harry and everything that he was going through.\\n\\nIf you don’t like this installment in the series, I completely understand why, but I’ll continue to love it for the rest of my life. This series will always hold a special place in my heart and I’ll always have fond memories of this book in particular.\\n\\nAs I feel it’s important to address problematic elements of books (even if they’re books I adore), here’s the problematic issues with this book.\\n-The whole “elves want to be enslaved and don’t want to be freed” narrative continues in this one unfortunately and people still get mad at Hermione for pointing out how elves shouldn’t be enslaved.\\n-The way that Lockhart is treated in this book is horrific. He is treated as comedy relief and as being that he is one of the only characters in this series who is mentally ill, that’s extremely problematic. This is also the huge reason why this book fell on my ranking of the series.\\n-It is heavily implied that Umbridge is raped by centaurs and the story doesn’t handle that topic well. It’s common in mythology for centaurs to rape people and the way that Umbridge reacts while in the hospital wing is really telling of what actually happened to her. She wasn’t hurt yet she was exhibiting a trauma response.\\n-The fact that the story brushes over how Snape was possibly sexually assaulted. Harry was pulled out of the pensieve so we’ll never know for sure what went down, but James wanting to take off Severus’ pants while in the front of a crowd… isn’t there better ways to show that two characters don’t get along??!\\n-The final one is debatable about whether it’s problematic or not, but Pansy being racist toward Angelina. It’s not problematic to include racism in books if it’s dealt with respectively. I’m not saying that the book doesn’t handle it respectively, but there’s very few characters of color in this series, so I find it suspicious that the author decided to include an act of racism against a very minor side character.\\n\\nFavorite quotes/moments:\\n-“You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.”\\n-\"Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit \\'N Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty, cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased that he was concealed behind the bush; Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever she met him in the street.\"\\n-\"\\'Why were you lurking under our window?\\'\\n\\'Yes - yes, good point, Petunia! \\'\\n\\'Listening to the news,\\' said Harry in a resigned voice.\\nHis aunt and uncle exchanged looks of outrage.\\n\\'Listening to the news! \\'\\n\\'Well, it changes every day, you see,\\' said Harry.\"\\n-\"\\'We\\'re not stupid, you know,\\' said Uncle Vernon.\\n\\'Well, news to me,\\' said Harry...\"\\n-\"...luckily I\\'d stationed Mr. Tibbles under a car just in case, and Mr. Tibbles came and warned me...\"\\n-\"\\'Yes, here, you worthless pile of bat droppings, here!\\' shrieked Mrs. Figg. \\'Dementors attacking the boy on your watch!\\'\"\\n-\"Mrs. Figg raised the arm from which her string bag dangled and whacked Mundungus around the face and neck with it; judging by the clanking noise it made it was full of cat food.\"\\n-\"Remus Lupin stood nearest him. Though still quite young, Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when Harry had said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at Harry, who tried to smile back through his shock.\\n\\'Oooh, he looks just like I thought he would,\\' said the witch who was holding her lit wand aloft. She looked the youngest there; she had a pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, and short spiky hair that was a violent shade of violet.\"\\n-\"Harry descended the stairs, very conscious of everybody still staring at him, stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jeans as he came.\\n\\'Don\\'t put your wand there, boy!\\' roared Moody. \\'What if it ignited? Better wizards than you have lost buttocks, you know!\\'\"\\n-\"\\'...you\\'re really lucky the Dursleys are out...\\' he mumbled.\\n\\'Lucky, ha!\\' said the violet-haired woman. \\'It was me that lured them out of the way. Sent a letter by Muggle post telling them they\\'d been short-listed for the All-England Best-Lept Suburban Lawn Competition. they\\'re heading off to the prize-giving right now... Or they think they are.\\'\"\\n-\"She screwed up her eyes in a strained expression as though she were struggling to remember something. A second later, her hair had turned bubble-gum pink.\"\\n-\"Shacklebolt and Sturgis Podmore were examining the microwave and Hestia Jones was laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawers.\"\\n-\"\\'Harry, I\\'ve left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry-\\'\\n\\'They won\\'t,\\' said Harry.\\n\\'That you\\'re safe-\\'\\n\\'That\\'ll just depress them.\\'\\n\\'-and you\\'ll see them next summer.\\'\\n\\'Do I have to?\\'\"\\n-\"...after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked as though it had been made from a severed troll\\'s leg...\"\\n-\"With two large cracks, Fred and George, Ron\\'s elder twin brothers, had materialized out of thin air in the middle of the room. Pidgewidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join Hedwif on top of the wardrobe.\"\\n-\"\\'Tonks told me how to find out,\\' said Ginny. \\'You just chuck stuff at the door and if it can\\'t make contact the door\\'s been Imperturbed. I\\'ve been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it...\\'\"\\n-\"\\'Remember old Fleur Delacour?\\' said George. \\'She\\'s got a job at Gringotts to -\\'\\n\\'-and Bill\\'s been giving her a lot of private lessons,\\' sniggered Fred.\"\\n-\"Percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his boss was being controlled by Lord Voldemort...\"\\n-\"Harry felt something brush against his knees and started, but it was only Crookshanks, Hermion\\'s bandy-legged ginger cat, who wound himself once around Harry\\'s legs, purring, then jumped onto Sirius\\'s lap and curled up. Sirius scratched him absentmindedly behind the ears...\"\\n-\"...Tonks was entertaining Hermione and Ginny by transforming her nose between mouthfuls. Screwing up her eyes each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in Harry\\'s bedroom, her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like Snape\\'s, shrank to something resembling a button mushroom, and then sprouted a great deal of hair from each nostril.\"\\n-\"...Ginny, whod had lured Crookshanks out from under the dresser, was sitting cross-legged on the floor, rolling butterbeer corks for him to chase.\"\\n-\"\\'...Dumbledore says he doesn\\'t care what they do as long as they don\\'t take him off the Chocolate Frog cards,\\' said Bill, grinning.\"\\n-\"If Ginny\\'s not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs, then I\\'m a flobberworm...\"\\n-\"\\'...size is no gurantee of power,\\' said George. \\'Look at Ginny.\\'\\n\\'What d\\'you mean?\\' said Harry.\\n\\'You\\'ve never been on the receiving end of one of her Bat-Bogey Hexes, have you?\\'\"\\n-\"...many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying, And Harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him...\"\\n-\"\\'I\\'ve just been feeding Buckbeak,\\' he added, in reply to Harry\\'s inquiring look. \\'I keep him upstairs in my mother\\'s bedroom.\\'\"\\n-\"\\'Right-o,\\' Fred said brightly, spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted, but the moment Mrs. Weasley\\'s back was turned he pocketed it with a wink.\\n\\'We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,\\' George told Harry under his breath.\"\\n-\"\\'Range of sweets to make you ill,\\' George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs. Weasley\\'s back. \\'Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been developing them this summer. They\\'re double-ended, color-coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you\\'ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half-\\'\\n\\'-which restores you to full fitness, enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom.\\'\"\\n-\"Harry grinned. He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand-Galleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs. Weasley, who did not think that running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons.\"\\n-\"\\'I love hearing Mum shouting at someone else,\\' said Fred, with a satisfied smile on his face as he opened the door an inch or so to allow Mrs. Weasley\\'s voice to permeat the room better. \\'It makes such a nice change.\\'\"\\n-\"\\'You ran away from home?\\'\\n\\'When I was about sixteen,\\' said Sirius. \\'I\\'d had enough.\\'\\n\\'Where did you go?\\' asked Harry, staring at him.\\n\\'Your dad\\'s place,\\' said Sirius. \\'Your grandparents were really good about it; they sort of adopted me as a second son. Yeah, I camped out at your dad\\'s during the school holidays, and then when I was seventeen I got a place of my own, my Uncle Alphard has left me a decent bit of gold - he\\'s been wiped off here too, that\\'s probably why - anyway, after that I looked after myself. I was always welcome at Mr. and Mrs. Potter\\'s for Sunday lunch, though.\\'\"\\n-\"\\'You and Tonks are related?\\' Harry asked, surprised.\\n\\'Oh yeah, her mother, Andromeda, was my favorite cousin,\\' said Sirius, examining the tapestry closely. \\'No, Andromeda\\'s not on here either, look-\\'\\nHe pointed to another small round burn mark between two names, Bellatrix and Narcissa.\\n\\'Andromed\\'a sisters are still here because they made lovely, respectable pure-blood marriages, but Andromeda married a Muggleborn,, Ted Tonks, so-\\'\"\\n-\"\\'The pure-blood families are all interrelated,\\' said Sirius. \\'If you\\'re only going to let your sons and daughters marry pureblood your choice is very limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur\\'s something like my second cousin once removed.\\'\"\\n-\"They found an unpleasant-looking silver instrument, something like a many-legged pair of tweezers, which scuttled up Harry\\'s arm like a spider when he picked it up, and attempted to puncture his skin; Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; also a heavy locket that none of them could open...\"\\n-\"Kreacher wasn\\'t as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still caught him snogging a pair of my father\\'s old trousers last week.\"\\n-\"Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help; Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed an unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passerby. Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs. Weasley\\'s eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe.\"\\n-\"Something very cold trickled down the back of Harry\\'s neck... he realized that Mrs. Weasley was attacking his hair with a wet comb. She pressed hard on the top of his head.\\n\\'Doesn\\'t it ever lie flat?\\' she said desperately.\"\\n-\"...through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallow his ticket)...\"\\n-\"A big, bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood nearby. The box was emitting rasping noises.\\n\\'All right, Arthur?\\' said the wizard, nodding at Mr. Weasley.\\n\\'What you\\'ve got there, Bob?\\' asked Mr. Weasley, looking at the box.\\n\\'We\\'re not sure,\\' said the wizard seriously. \\'We thought it was a bog-standard chicken until it started breathing fire. Looks like a serious breach of the Ban on Experimental Breeding to me.\\'\"\\n-\"\\'Just Interdepartmental memoes,\\' Mr. Weasley muttered to him. \\'We used to use owls, but the mess was unbelievable... droppings all over the desks...\\'\\nAs they clattered upward again, the memoes flapped around the swaying lamp in the lift\\'s ceiling.\"\\n-\"\\'And don\\'t take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.\\'\\n\\'If you read my report you would know that the term is \\'firearms,\\' said Mr. Weasley coolly. \\'And I\\'m afraid you\\'ll have to wait for information on motorcycles, we\\'re extremely busy at the moment.\\' He dropped his voice and said, \\'If you can get away before seven, Molly\\'s making meatballs.\\'\"\\n-\"\\'A regurgitating toiler?\\'\\n\\'Anti-Muggle pranksters,\\' said Mr. Weasley, frowning. \\'We had two last week, one in Wimbledon, one in Elephant and Castle. Muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing - well, you can imagine.

I feel evil *evil laugh*\\n\\n\\nEdit #1: 8\\\\3\\\\2014\\nIt has been four months that I posted this review. And so far I have received great feedback. Thank you everyone for yo#ur support ^^\\nRemember, this is not a benign cause.\\n\\n6/11/2013\\nI know that I have neglected the subject of the new Goodreads policy a lot recently, and I ought not to have done that. You see, I wasn’t very free recently, and well because I didn’t know what to either say or on what book should I post it.\\nAnd then I read this book, and the rebelliousness in this book made me think that hey, this book is perfect for what I have in mind. Oh, and guess what! I am going to be aggressive.\\n\\nLet me tell you something maybe a lot of you people are not aware of. We, people who live in the Middle East, look up towards the west, where presumably, everyone is free to say and do whatever they want, bounded by no tradition or religious law whatsoever. But when this kind of law is forced upon everyone from the west itself, we lose hope. We lose hope that anything will be good again. And well for someone (me), who has suffered a lot because of that (Facebook only made my freedom of speech more restricted), I found a haven for myself in Goodreads, where apparently no one gives a damn whether you insult or disagree with them because well, they don’t care. And because they are mature enough to ignore any insults under the pretext that it is “your opinion”.\\nDo you know how much I love that? I have suffered A LOT because of that. Let me tell you something about myself. I never EVER stay quiet about something that I believe to be true – even if I was wrong to many other people – and now Mister Money-Head-Of-Amazon has to ruin that for me.\\n\\nAll right, I realized that everything that was said about the new policy was said in the utmost civilized way. But guess what! I am a teenager. I don’t give a damn about manners, and I am about to say what everyone has wanted to say for a long time.\\n\\nGoodreads by succumbing to the green papers have restricted my freedom of speech. In the last few years, I have been bullied, put down, humiliated, insulted, punished… just because I wanted to say what I had in mind, just because I always stand up to what I believe in. And since because ALL OF THAT HAPPENED TO ME, I turned towards Goodreads where I was surprised that no one cared about whatever I said, and always respected me when I wanted to express myself.\\nNo review of mine has been removed, but a lot of people’s reviews have been removed. Since it didn’t affect me yet, I should shut up, right? No! Just the fact that it exists is bothering me. It is like having this law around forbidding people to eat chicken, and I hate chicken, but that doesn’t mean I should keep quiet. Okay, that was a bad example, but the closest I had to the ridiculousness of what we are fighting for. No one should fight for his right to express himself freely. It is a right. We are born with that right. And no number of reviews removed is going to change that. It is not going to frighten us. It is not going to make us back out. You can remove all the reviews you want, Goodreads, but this is something I believe in. So I am fighting, even if you have to ban me. Well, according to your own policy, you can't do that. Well, you can't even remove the reviews that have been put the declaration of that censorship but you do it anyway. So you are bunch of hypocrites.\\n\\nYou, Goodreads managers, anyone with the IQ of a peacock can realize that what you have done is so wrong on so many levels.\\nIf I were the Goodreads manager, I would say this to the Amazon Manager when he came offering the new law “You can take your money and your pathetic ass out of my office! You cannot threaten us with money or hold it over our heads! This company has so far made you millions of money just by existing and promoting your books! More than half of our members buy regularly from your website! In fact, according to this logic, you owe us!” GR Manager slaps Amazon Manager.\\nJackie Shan bursts into the scene wearing nothing but a newspaper around his waist.\\nKung fu! Jackie kicks Amazon Manager’s head off, and his body goes around looking for its head. Meanwhile, GR Manager holds both the head and the body and throws them from the window of the headquarters. BOOM! The end.\\n\\nThis policy is so wrong. If people like us cannot express themselves online, then where will they? I might not insult your precious little authors, Amazon Manager (in my opinion they shouldn’t be called authors if they can’t take god damn criticism. Not everyone should approve with them), but I have every god damn right to express myself freely without having to worry whether my review would be removed or not.\\nThe management even has no right to go around reading whatever we say online because well, I thought they had better things to do. It turns out I was wrong, don’t you think? Anyway, what we say online is OUR concern, not yours. You shouldn’t threaten us. You shouldn’t condemn us.\\nMaybe to you, you are only deleting a review, but to us you are restricting our freedom. And no one really appreciates freedom but the ones who have been deprived from it. I wonder how the Goodreads Management even agreed to this.\\nI had a lot more to say about this on my mind, but I think I have made my point quite clearly. Us, readers, and the ones who write a bit like I do, find words our strongest weapon.\\n\\n\\nBack to my review about this book.\\nTHIS WAS THE WORST BOOK I HAVE READ! I have cried 50 pages straight.\\n\\nThe 5 stars I have given it, it was not a “WOW I LOVED THIS BOOK AUTOMATIC FIVE STARS!” No. It was this kind of books “it deserves 5 stars, with a little dash of wow at the end”.\\nThis is the kind of perfect books that makes you feel as though all happiness, innocence and hope had been sucked out of the world, and until everything in the book is fixed, nothing in the world will ever be right again.\\nI have really a lot of controversial feelings about this book, but it all goes down to one point. It is good. It is worthy of five stars. And it had hooked me up five days straight.\"},\n",

Things are starting to get dark, they\\'re starting to get serious and it sets the tone for the next two books to come. I love Harry coming to take on his role as \"The Chosen One\"\\n\\nSecondly, side characters! Thanks to the DA, we get to see soo much more of the school aside from the golden trio. Neville, Luna, GINNY, Fred and George, Dean, Seamus, Tonks, Sirius, Remus, Cho and soo many other characters who I just adore SHINE and it makes me so happy. I love the side characters as much as the trio and they get so much more screen time (page time?) then in earlier books\\n\\nSO MANY COOL SCENES: I mean, the Weasley escape, the interview in three broomsticks, every DA meeting, Harry\\'s first date, THE QUIDDITCH PITCH BRAWL, Umbridge being taken by Centaurs, the fight in the ministry, Dumbledore and Voldermorts epic duel ! There are so many scenes to love in this one. Literally iconic scenes like DA and the Weasley\\'s leaving school can be exclusively found in ootp and I love them so much.\\n\\nI also just think OoTP is SO funny? I mean, the whole school rioting against Umbridge, the twins pranks, the DA meetings, the things said about Harry / that Harry says back. I laugh out loud when I\\'m reading this book, and I don\\'t usually properly laugh when I\\'m reading.\\n\\nI literally just don\\'t understand how anyone can not like ootp. I mean, beside the very sad events at the end, it\\'s perfect. And EVEN that sad event\\ngives us such a beautiful moment between Albus and Harry, that is sad, but also so incredibly human and heartbreaking and such an insight into the humanity and love that drives Harry\\'s character it\\'s amazing.\\n\\nanyway, tbh it\\'s harry potter I shouldn\\'t have to say much I loved reading this with all my heart, obviously.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'Book Review\\n4 out of 5 stars for Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the 5th book in the original 7 book \"Harry Potter\" young adult fantasy series published in 2003 by J.K. Rowling. I cannot believe this is over 15 years old, as I think about what I want to put in my review. Given it\\'s HP, and everyone does review on it, I\\'m keeping it short. A few things I loved about this book:\\n\\n1. Dolores Umbridge is awesome. Awesome as a villain, that is. She brings out the worst in so many people, and other then the Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort, Harry needs a foil on a day-to-day basis.\\n\\n2. More dementors! Those have always been one of my favorite parts. And to see Harry protect his cousin Dudley... well that\\'s just cool!\\n\\n3. The whole Pollyjuice potion usage at the trial is awesome.\\n\\n4. Snape\\'s history is slowly unveiled.\\n\\n5. It sets them on the battle against the Dark One to end all battles in the next couple of books!\\n\\n\\nFor those new to me or my reviews... here\\'s the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT. First the book review goes on Goodreads, and then I send it on over to my WordPress blog at , where you\\'ll also find TV & Film reviews, the revealing and introspective 365 Daily Challenge and lots of blogging about places I\\'ve visited all over the world.

       "    'review': 'Re-read 1/17/22:\\n\\nReading it with my girl. It was satisfying for both how much we hated Umbridge and how much we absolutely adored the twins. I mean, gloriously so.\\n\\nI hope to teach her that we should all disobey authority 100% when it is so right to do so.\\n\\nCan we get an amen to that?\\n\\n\\n\\nOriginal Review:\\n\\nWow! I can tell you that on a re-read, this story really stands out as both a very dark turn and a wonderfully complex story.\\n\\nWhy is my memory so poor, you ask? Because while I remember it being this good when I first read it, I\\'ve only had the altered perceptions of the movie to go by ever since! And that is a MISTAKE.\\n\\nI should have known. Short movies like that can\\'t do real justice to heavy, heavy tomes like this novel. :)\\n\\nNotably missing: the TWINS! Sure, they get their big time to shine in the movie, but they don\\'t get the backstory of where they got their money or the sheer amount of legwork and field-testing for their jokes right on Hogwarts\\' grounds. So delicious!\\n\\nAlso missing: an actually delightful Dobby. I can\\'t believe how much knitting Hermione went through on her quest to free all the house elves and only Dobby was willing to take her clothing, all to save her feelings. How Sweet!\\n\\nAlso missing: long explanations and carefully constructed dream-plots and traps that make complete sense unlike that mess we saw in the movie that just kinda slaps us in a direction and lets us be surprised... Hey! Look where we are, and we\\'re fighting! Sheesh.\\n\\nAll I can say is, \"Bravo, Voldemort! Yours was actually a pretty good plan even if you\\'re missing a certain piece of intelligence.\"\\n\\nAll told, I can honestly say that I liked this one better than all the rest up to this point. There\\'s not so much flash and dash as all the rest, except with the blowout battle with the Deatheaters and Voldemort and Dumbledore at the end, but there is way more than enough conflict and rising tension for three lesser books. We all know this is a dark story with Dolores.\\n\\nWhat fantastic fun!'},\n",

       "    'review': 'IT TOOK ME OVER A YEAR BUT IM FINALLY DONE WITH THIS MONSTER OF A BOOK AND IM SO GLAD ITS OVER\\n\\nI honestly didn’t think I’d ever finish this, it was such a ridiculously long story that was badly written, a super stretched plot (it REALLY didn’t need to be this long) and 99% of the characters I couldn’t stand since they either exaggerated every scene they were in or were just whining the whole way through.\\n\\nI started off by reading the physical book which was such a bad choice as I had the first edition hardback which is so big and heavy I couldn’t bring it with me anywhere. Also reading Harry Potter is often a snooze and so at nearly halfway through - where I put the book down for months with no intention to continue - I realised it was either audiobook or nothing. So for the rest of the story I had to listen to hours and hours of a plot with no actual development to end with about 50 pages of the only bit of action in the book?\\n\\nNone of the characters were actually doing anything interesting throughout, so many unnecessary scenes! Why was there a Quidditch scene in there, it had nothing to do with the story! Do we really need to know what’s on every floor in St Mungo’s? There were so many useless scenes with Cho Chang that weren’t needed because it was clear the two were going nowhere. And to at least help redeem that, why didn’t Rowling at least make her likeable?? Her stupid unrealistic childish jealously nearly made me want to rip my hair out.\\n\\nI HATE HARRY. SO MUCH.\\n\\nFirstly, he couldn’t be any more cliché: dead parents, clever and dumb sidekicks, an evil master trying to kill him because he’s ‘the chosen one’ etc. (and before you fight me no, hp is not the starting point of novels with these clichés, Rowling took this idea from other books so shut up) and secondly, I read the previous books in this series, actually liking some, and I really can’t remember Harry being this much of a whiny and ridiculous character. He complained about EVERYTHING and he’s one of the dumbest characters I’ve ever read about, always making the wrong choices and he gets angry at every single person who tries to talk to him with a single bit of logic??? He’s 16, not 5! I couldn’t bring myself to like him one bit.\\n\\nThe whole Umbridge thing is sooo over the top! Hogwarts would never allow someone like her in charge because of how extreme she is and the terrible portrayal of a ‘bad guy’ by Rowling. She is carving into Harry’s skin as punishment and Dumbledore somehow knows nothing about it? And if he does, he lets it happen in his school? Nah, I don’t buy it.\\n\\nThe writing style is incredibly repetitive and boring (did I mention this yet?) with every character speaking in exactly the same way (only Hagrid stands out) and with Rowling feeling the need to add ‘said’ after nearly every line spoken. Some variation in words or sentence structure please???\\n\\nI’m still going to carry on with the series because although this one was a massive disappointment and the writing difficult to bear, I enjoyed POA and GOF enough to want to find out the differences between the film ending and the book ending at the very end. Those books are also fairly big and I’m hoping they’re not as painful to read as this one.\\n\\nTHIS IS THE MOST OVERHYPED SERIES OF ALL TIME.\\n\\nIf you want to read a good fantasy series, anything by Brandon Sanderson, Patrick Rothfuss or J.R.R.Tolkien will be a much better example of good written fantasy novels with better developed characters and a most interesting plot. Have a good day.\\n\\n1.5 stars out of five. And I’m really not sorry.'},\n",

His expression was calm, almost detached. “You care so much you feel as though you will bleed to death with the pain of it.”\\n\\n\\nfollows a world where Lord Voldemort has officially returned. Harry is starting his fifth year in a world where his influence is everywhere in the Wizarding World and his followers are quickly returning to his side. In response, the Order of the Phoenix, a group created during the first war to stop him, has gathered together again, now with some new members. Problems are showing up at Hogwarts, too, where government officials are meddling in everything. Harry also has a powerful connection to Voldemort, which seems to be growing even stronger, and he soon realizes that he has direct access to the Dark Lord’s mind. It’s time for Harry and his friends to take action, but the course they choose will have terrible consequences.\\n\\nis my second favorite book in this series, despite a character death that has hurt my soul my entire life. takes no liberties in this book, and was absolutely determined to make this story even darker and more complex as it goes on. There’s so, so much plot and character development, and the series has officially taken a dark, awful turn. Since this is my 24th reread of the series, I’m no longer surprised when I read it, but I’m still amazed by how incredible and captivating this book is. And how absolutely it is for Harry, honestly.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs much as I think the characters have had some wonderful character development, I still dislike Ginny, and this book is kind of a big reason why. I’m not going to go fully into it (because I’ve had rants longer than this book on it), but I absolutely, 100% do not agree with people who say she handled Harry’s moods and depression really well in this book. She definitely didn’t, and honestly, neither did Hermione most of the time. That being said, anyone who says Harry is a whiny child in this book can fucking fight me—Ginny and Hermione included. He deserves so much better, but we know that. Also, Luna. That's all.\\n\\nOverall, I loved so, so much, obviously. I loved the humor and the characters and the world that’s developing so nicely. I love these rereads and getting back into the world created. I know it’s been fifteen years, but that’s not going to stop me from being absolutely devastated by the major character death in this book, and thinking he also deserves so much better.

       "    'review': \"“Wit beyond measure is a man's greatest treasure.”\\n\\n\\n\\nReread - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix always gives me a challenge whenever I start reading. It's 870 pages for US edition and 1000+ pages for Thai edition. The book starts off with a summer when Harry banters with Dudley, and there comes the Dementors. So Harry has to use his magic to expel those nasty things. He never knows before his act will bring him to M.o.M. In the beginning, J.K. Rowling used the first few chapters to introduce us about the Order of the Phoenix. That got me chilled the first time I was reading about this order. I loved to see the good guys being together and figthing the Dark Lord. I was so excited about this book anyway.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a feeling that Harry in this book is not like Harry, the one I know, he throws a tantrum when his friends don't believe about what happened last year. I understand about his age making him not stable, if I can call it. The only person I want to talk about is , I call her the pink toad, she's the character that unify everything around this book impeccably. Seeing everyone fighting with her and restraining her not to destroy the Hogwart's system make this book unique unlike the first four books. I couldn't stop laughing then.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI laughed out loud because of this scene. This book contains many emotions I can't describe all of it in one review. Do you believe me ? It is far better than the movie and the last M.o.M. scene is beyond exciting. The movie cut it out and I was so angry for that !\\n\\n\\n\\nThe sad thing in this book is about Sirius. If you've read it, you'll know why. Every time I get my head around it, I want to cry and cry. It's so touching and heartwrenching to see that thing happens. Nonetheless, reading this book is like growing up. There's not only happiness in your life, you have to face so many regrets and learn how to move on like Harry and his friends. All I can say is this book is not just a book, it's my life !\\n\\n\\n\\nMore at\"},\n",

Fuck you.\\n● Molly being unable to get rid of the boggart in Grimmauld Place because she is overtaken by emotion of seeing all of her loved ones dead… and then Lupin having to get rid of it after seeing Harry\\'s dead body on the floor - oh my lawd - and then Sirius having seen Harry\\'s dead body as well probably remembering the time he found James and Lily dead - WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?\\n● this year being the first year Harry wouldn\\'t be able to travel the Hogwarts Express with Ron since he and Hermione had to go to the Prefect\\'s carriage and then patrol the corridors, I cry\\n● Dean telling the others that his parents are unaware of the deaths happening at Hogwarts because he doesn\\'t inform them. - ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

I don\\'t see you risking your neck.\" It was just a little too fucking much for my heart, ugh\\n● Molly crying because PERCY SENT BACK his CHRISTMAS JUMPER… how fucking dare he\\n● Harry getting into Snape\\'s memory by using the Pensieve after Snape left his office.. m\\'boy, how stupid are you tho??? That whole situation when Snape found him there was just too fucking tense, I cannot deal !\\n● Umbridge revealing she sent the Dementors after Harry in Little Whinging … so fucking crazy, this hoe!\\n● \"Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole, you had suffered.\" - IS DUMBY FUCKING SERIOUS RIGHT NOW? Harry was severely abused (mentally, verbally and physically) for 10 fucking years and Dumby had the audacity to tell him that this was exactly what he had planned? Kill him with fire.\\n\\n(UK edition)\\nWhat can I say? This is my all time favorite Harry Potter book! (Probably my all time favorite book-book that isn\\'t a classic even though it kinda is, right?)\\n\\nAnd funnily enough has always been my favorite, ever since I discovered as a 11 year old that my (German) copy of it had over 1000 pages (1024 pages to be exact :D) and I felt sooo accomplished by reading a book with over 1000 pages and \"getting\" it and loving it.\\n\\nThe reason why is so precious to me is because in this one I got the best examination of Hogwarts as a school and how deep the bond between students, students and teachers and their sense of belonging to the Wizarding Community is. In my opinion the real villain in this wasn\\'t Lord Voldemort but Dolores Umbridge. I loved that she was a threat INSIDE OF HOGWARTS and therefore made the students feel afraid and uncomfortable within bounds that used to be the most safest and comforting. I loved how the whole school united to take her down (except for some Slytherins... but oh well JKR really needed to keep that stereotype right? smh). I laughed tears when we got to the scene in which Umbridge is punishing Harry constantly because he did the Quibbler interview about how the Dark Lord is returning and Fudge is telling lies. And all the other teachers want to show Harry their support and so Madame Sprout awards Gryffindor 20 points because HARRY PASSED HER A FUCKING WATERING CAN or Flitwick secretly slips him sweets after his lessons and Trelawney \"sees in the future\" that Harry would live \"to ripe old age and become Minister for Magic\". I couldn\\'t man, it was sooo fucking perfect. It made me furiously happy.\\n\\nI also really loved the way Luna was introduced and what she brought to the story. Because she is kind of an outcast and a nutter but at the same time she is portrayed in such a way that you as a reader really get to see how clever and right she is about things. And her loyalty to Harry gets me every time. That she actually flew with the crew to the Ministry of Magic is just a crazy act of bravery (because she literally only got to know Harry & Co. half a year ago)... this girl, man, I love her so much.\\n\\nA lot of people think that is the worst in the series because \"Harry is so moody in this one\". To people who firmly believe that all I can say is: FUCK YOU. Well that is a little harsh but I have so much compassion when it comes to Harry. I feel so much protectiveness and I hate it when people give him shit. Harry fucking Potter was abused since he was a toddler in the most nastiest way by his uncle, aunt and cousin and he fucking remained a good person and didn\\'t turn bitter or all psycho. He is the most humble character that I know and honestly sooo pure and innocent. He is used as a chess piece by Dumbledore but is still willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good and he is just my little baby and if you\\'re coming for him I WILL FIGHT YOU. Of course he is fucking moody in . First and foremost HE IS A FRIGGIN TEENAGER and teenagers ARE MOODY (get over it) and he feels fucking left out because Dumbledore is purposefully leaving him in the dark and he is just confused as fuck. He feels estranged from his friends (and all the other students from Hogwarts) because the fucking News are reporting about him and what a lying little shit he is DAILY. How do you deal with that? Then we have the little shit Umbridge who is tormenting him more than any other student and if I were Harry I would be just as fucking moody as him. He has every right to be.\\n\\nThe whole Sirius situation is also quite tragic. Sirius isn\\'t my favorite character because he is so manipulative and basically causing a deeper drift between Harry and his friends. But on the other hand I understand Sirius\\' behaviour to the fullest because for him Harry equals James (his best friend he lost in a fucking tragic way; probs still blaming himself for his death) and on top of that he was held captive in Azkaban for 13 friggin\\' years (thanks for nothing, Dumbledore, you little shit) and his mind was just bound to be fucked because of this. So the whole Sirius situation is rather complex and I feel compassion for him - especially since Dumbledore (the little shit) forced him to be bound to his old childhood home - a place that only gives him anxiety and which is linked to his darkest memories (I mean can you imagine being exposed to a screaming portrait of the mother who hated you with all her heart).\\n\\nSo overall, had just the perfect mix of funny, tragic, beautiful, witty, depressing and real moments of any of the Harry Potter books and it will forever stay in my heart.\\n\\nThings I forgot to mention but that are golden in this are RON AND HERMIONE BECOMING FUCKING PREFECTS, RON BECOMING A MEMBER OF THE QUIDDITCH TEAM (so proud of him and the whole Weasley is our King-subplot is all I needed in my life), Harry\\'s disastrous date with Cho Chang in Hogsmeade, Dumbledore\\'s freaking Army. I can\\'t deal. SOO MUCH WAS IN HERE AND I COULD CRY!!'},\n",

       "    'review': \"*This was a reread for me*\\n\\nThis has always been my least favorite book and movie in the entire series and I’ve never really understood why. I didn’t know whether it was the plot, the characters OR the fact this book super long. Despite this being my least favorite I still, of course, loved it but now that I’ve reread it I’ve noticed many different things I’ve missed when I read it for the first time. This book is still amazing and I obviously will give it five stars.\\n\\nLet me start off by saying this book as many can tell, is humongous and requires a lot of commitment. I know that many including myself are intimidated by this book. Can I also just say the writing also very small. Don’t get me wrong I have nothing against long books. In fact, I prefer long books over books with only 100 pages but this book was just unnecessarily too long. I’ve realized that there is a huge amount of pointless information. I know sometimes authors can’t help it but I feel like I’m reading for so long but am not getting anywhere. Now you’re probably asking why I gave it 5 stars if I think some of it was unnecessary. I am a big fan of Harry Potter and I know what I’m saying isn’t true but if I gave HP less than 5 stars it would make me (and I’m not saying this about anyone else) feel like I'm not a true fan. I know that’s not true but it’s what I think of .\\n\\nI don’t know about anyone else but in bookstores, HP has always been in the children’s section. And I know I know HP is a supposed to be children series but honestly, I do not consider this a children’s series because well I think anyone of any age can read it and I cannot imagine 7 years or whatever reading an 800-page book. I don’t maybe there are children that age that do but personally I can’t imagine it.\\n\\nThis book made me realize something I never realized before which is…\\n\\nHarry Potter is the most stuck up person ever and thinks he’s amazing. Honestly, this book made realize why Draco is so mean to him. I’m warning you right now I am going to rant so I’m sorry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat I hate so much is how Harry gets all the credit! He’s not that amazing and without his friends, he would have done nothing. Do you think in the first book he could have going to through that place where they had to play chess and figure out the potion without his friends? Ron figured the chess game and Hermione found out which potion. The only reason he could defeat Voldemort was because he couldn’t be touched. Also in the second book do you think he would have any idea what was down in the chamber of secrets and what was freezing all the student without Hermione. I guess in the third book he did do a Patronus, I’ll give him that. In the fourth book, he only won because someone was helping him but I’ll give him credit for escaping Voldemort but that was because of his wand and that Voldemort told him to fight him.\\n\\nI get he is powerful but most of it was done with help. Without Ron and Hermione, he couldn’t have done even half the things he did. I can’t even imagine what would have happened. He needs to stop thinking he’s amazing and that he is the only person to have gone through tough times because he isn’t. I actually understand Draco’s POV in the situation now.\\n\\nIt pisses me off because Harry is actually so DUMB (I'll get into more detail about that in the 6th book) but manages to become famous and everyone thinks he so powerful. I'd like to see what he'd achieve without his friends.\\n\\nWow…I needed to get that out\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall I still think this book was great. Although it wasn’t the best book to try and finish a reading challenge. I’m glad I reread this book because I realized a lot and picked up things I missed before. I still loved this book and thought it was amazing. Also, I understand sometimes books need to be long and cutting out sections is not easy which is why books are sometimes so long.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"On this sunny Mother's Day, my middle child suggested that the perfect gift for me would be to finish reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix outside, aloud to her. She wanted us to reach the dramatic conclusion earlier in the day, so the intensity of the ending wouldn't negatively impact her dreams. We've been reading book #5 at night, one chapter at a time, and the mature shift that has taken place in the last few chapters, into violence and loss, has been peppering her sleep lately with images of Bellatrix Lestrange and flashing green lights (hexes!).\\n\\nSo, we finished the book today (it was the first time for her, a reread for me), and even though I still consider this book to be overweight by about 100 pages, I enjoyed it even more the second time. I cried a lot more this round, too.\\n\\nWithout revealing spoilers, I will describe, simply, that the ending of is intense and includes a violent climax between Lord Voldemort and Professor Dumbledore. On page 814, amid raised wands and loud explosions, Voldemort snarls, “There is nothing worse than death, Dumbledore!\\n\\nDumbledore responds to this quietly (despite all of the commotion) by telling Voldemort, “You are quite wrong. . . Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness--”\\n\\nI took a pause from reading here and closed the book and asked my daughter, “What do you think he means? What do you think is worse than death?”\\n\\nWithout hesitation, my middle child answered, “Sadness. Like the kind of sadness that never stops.”\\n\\nI was taken aback by her answer. As a migraine sufferer, I would have answered “physical pain that won't stop.”\\n\\nBut, pain is pain, right? And, if you suffer it long enough, regardless of its source, you may get to the point where you perceive death as a sweet release rather than a “worse case scenario.”\\n\\nWhen Dumbledore turns this thinking around to Harry and tells him “the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength,” Harry rejects this philosophy and shouts, “I DON'T CARE! I'VE HAD ENOUGH, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, I WANT OUT, I WANT IT TO END, I DON'T CARE ANYMORE--”\\n\\nWow. How brilliant was J.K. Rowling, in using the span of this big, bold, epic, magical story. . .\\n\\nto explain the loss of innocence, the frequent crippling sense of isolation, and the it-feels-impossible-to-go-on quality of adolescence?\\n\\nMy hat's not just off, Ms. Rowling. It's on the floor.\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"I have read the Harry Potter septuology in its entirety at least ten times. This book is the turning point and also the most difficult for me to read. For starters, I detest Umbrage that foul woman. In fact I abhor her to the point that on occasion I have skipped from book 4 to 6 just to avoid her.\\nOrder of the Phoenix is a whopping 870 pages. J K Rowling's prose has transformed from being geared toward kids to teenagers, mirroring Harry's own development. In books 1-4, the language is easy enough that despite the length even middle grade kids should be able to read it. Book 5 is more tedious. The themes are darker and tougher to digest. Additionally the students are interested in dating, making the content slightly inappropriate for younger readers.\\nProse aside, we see new characters and many developments in the plot lines. We witness how powerful Dumbledore's abilities are the clear distinctions between Voldemort's death eaters and Dumbledore's army. The end makes it challenging for me to finish the entire book even after all these times because I know what is coming. Looking forward to books 6 and 7 which I enjoy much more than this one.\"},\n",

       "    'review': 'I started reading Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on 9/15/2018 and finished it on 2/1/2019. (Please ignore the date in this case because it has nothing to do with the book being good or bad. I experience the worst reading slump ever.) This book is a great read! I love learning about Sirius and his family tree. Further along, the story gets a bit boring and long winded. The first time I read this story I loved it but now I feel Harry whines too much and then he constantly landed himself in trouble despite his teammates asking him that they are relying on him or Hermione’s repeated sayings of his friends’ support. I decided to watch the movie again at page 330 and I must say, this movie has no Quidditch game at all. That’s disappointing. I pushed through even though those bans from Umbridge really ruin many excitements for me, like having Harry play the Quidditch. I don’t even get to enjoy how Ginny caught the snitch right under Cho’s nose. I do laugh out loud with Ron’s OWL test in divination though, hilarious!\\n\\nThis book is told in the third person point of view following Harry Potter as he spends the summer at his aunt Petunia’s house. He’s feeling bored and frustrated that this past 2 months he hasn’t heard from his friends about what’s going on in the wizarding world, especially news of You-Know-Who after his encounter before the year ended. Then one day while out walking with his cousin Dudley, two dementors came to attack Harry. More people show up on Privet Drive to escort Harry to a secret society in London. Harry is being threatened with losing his wand and expulsion from Hogwarts for breaking the rules of using magic outside of school. Furthermore, Harry just now finds out that over the summer in the Wizarding World, he’s being ridiculed for lying that You Know Who is back. Life at school is no longer the place Harry loves to get away from his uncle and aunt’s house when Professor Dumbledore ignores him and the new Professor puts up new bans almost every other day.\\n\\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is very well written. I do like how the villain Professor Umbridge is written in this story. She appeared so sweet on the outside with her pink outfits and doilies but wicked evil on the inside with her mean ways punishments. I love Prof McGonagall’s stern attitude with Prof Umbridge. She’s really good with ignoring Umbridge’s throat clearing. I love the humor with past headmasters’ comments. I always love Prof Dumbledore’s uniqueness. The magical world is neat as always, with people moving in photos and picture frames to the magical powers of reading minds. Though it’s lengthy and ongoing at times, it at least offers a bit more of Quidditch than the movie, so I do recommend everyone to read this book!\\n\\nPro: friendships, mystery, suspense, humor, magical world, fast paced, page turner, easy to read, illustrations, challenges and overcoming obstacles, cleverness, teamwork, anger management\\n\\nCon: Harry is more whiny than usual\\n\\nI rate it 4.5 stars!\\n\\n***Disclaimer: Reading books I bought for a change..\\n\\nxoxo,\\nJasmine at'},\n",

We finally get a broader picture of the wizarding community and realize that not everyone is so quick to believe that Voldemort is back. We see the aftermath of Cedric\\'s death and Voldemort\\'s rise and watch as Harry grows more and more angry at everyone\\'s denial and disbelief.\\n\\nThings that make this book so incredible:\\n🧙🏻\\u200d♀️ The Order of the Phoenix. Each member is so unique and special. I love that they all bring something different to the table and are all so bad-ass.\\n\\n🧙🏻\\u200d♀️Kreacher. He is horrible and hilarious. I love that a house elf gets an important storyline and is so subtlely apart of the overall \\'big bad\\' in the story.\\n\\n🧙🏻\\u200d♀️ Dolores Umbridge. She is literally the worst. She almost makes you forget how much we hate Voldemort which I think is the brilliance of her character.\\n\\n🧙🏻\\u200d♀️ Sirius Black. 😭😭😭 He loves Harry so much.\\n\\n🧙🏻\\u200d♀️Ron and Hermoine. They are really the best representation of friends. They will call Harry on his crap but always back him up when it matters.\\n\\n🧙🏻\\u200d♀️ Luna and Nevil. I love them. I love how unassuming both of them are and yet how quickly they become apart of the gang and are so important to the resolution of the story.\\n\\n🧙🏻\\u200d♀️ Dumbledore\\'s army. Hermoine was a rebel!! It makes my heart so happy. The kids sticking it to the Ministry by naming themselves the very thing the Ministry was afraid of.

       "    'review': \"Instead of a review, I’m just going to share my memories of this book. Back when this came out was the high time of midnight bookstore release parties. Yes, I did go to one and no, I didn’t dress up.\\n\\nIt was held at a Barnes and Noble and of course John Williams’s soundtrack for the first 2 movies was played on a loop throughout the night. Amidst the crowd eagerly awaiting the stroke of 12, were tired adult chaperones and sullen workers who had . My brother brought me to the store and one of his friends was working there; of course being the only ginger on staff he had to dress up like Ron and appreciate it. I think he actually hated Harry Potter so that kind of made it worse.\\n\\n\\nLet me preface this next paragraph with the following: I grew up in Las Vegas, so some weird stuff went down that probably wouldn’t have happened anywhere else that night. Not only did the show up, but did too. They are local celebs, though why they put in an appearance is beyond me. More on this in a minute.\\n\\n\\nSo at about 11:30 everyone starts lining up to get our books. The store decided to release them before midnight and that made it all the more like catnip. I remember seeing some four year olds plopped down in an aisle with their copies, pretending to read them…and I thought, I didn’t though, obviously, but Potter fever makes you think strange thoughts, especially while waiting in line for a highly anticipated book.\\n\\nBoth the Mayor and the “Master Magician” were signing copies of the book. I don’t understand this at all, and still think that somewhere on ebay somebody must have bid on an “autographed copy” and gotten one signed by one of these men. While that’s technically true, can you just imagine the disappointment??\\n\\n\\nWhen I did finally have it in my hands… oh, that beautiful gloriously blue cover. You knew from ’s artwork that something major was going to go down, and it did. I started reading it with a booklight on the drive home but was told that the light was distracting my brother’s driving. Buzzkill. Didn’t he know how important this was?!?!?!?!\\n\\n\\nArriving home, I went straight to bed and stayed up all night reading. At some point, I think at about 2am, my mom came into my room. She took the book from me, and flipped towards the end, read about Sirius’s death, then gave it back to me without a word. (She had read the first 4 to her third grade class and still chokes up at the mention of “the boy who lived”). She never actually read the fifth book or the rest, but always insisted I tell her everything that happened once I finished them.\\n\\nI finished it later that day. I didn't care too much that Sirius died, but I do remember being slightly miffed that Rowling never cleared up more about that Veil in the Department of Mysteries. That was such a cruel tease, Jo.\"},\n",

It\\'s so sad, so devastating, worth so much more than the four stars I HAVE to give it. While I know that all of this terrible treatment of Harry is indicative of where the story leads, I can\\'t help but think of how much abuse is so blatant within the pages of this book. How Dumbledore allows Dolores Umbridge to walk the halls of his school for so long, I will never know. How he allows Snape to bully and demean the students he doesn\\'t deem worthy, I will never understand. How he allows Harry to walk through so much of his confusion alone, I will never forgive him. I like Dumbledore, I don\\'t believe he deserves the amount of hate he gets, I think he fights for all the right things, just goes about them in the wrong ways.\\n\\nThis book is simply a letter on why sometimes: adults need to learn from children.\\n\\nMolly Weasley is the only adult in Harry\\'s life who always had his best interest at heart. The only adult who thinks of him first, the only one who keeps things from him for the simple reason that he\\'s still so young. Every other adult either wants to treat him as though he\\'s James or keep him out of the loop to \"protect him\" when all they\\'re really doing is alienating him. Even his friends, the people he relies on most, don\\'t ever give him the respect he deserves for suffering all that he does.\\n\\nThis book breaks my heart because Harry deserves better for a lot of things, but mostly for always being the last to know information when it\\'s HIS life on the line.\\n\\nBut now I\\'m going to stop ranting and tell you what I love. I love how Voldemort and Harry\\'s connection is explained and expanded on. I think it\\'s one of the coolest things that has ever been written into a book, and it makes me giddy to read the last 100 pages or so of this book. Every time. Without fail.\\n\\nI love that we see Harry grow up right in front of our eyes (because the adults in his life force him to). I love that we watch him become a leader, a teacher, a person who stands up for the truth even when no one is there to stand by his side. I love that he doesn\\'t back down, that he\\'s so patient with every single person that asks him for his story. I love that he\\'s willing to walk through his grief as many times as it\\'s necessary to finally get someone to believe him. I love that he never gives up.\\n\\nI love that this book is so long (even if I complain about it the entire time) because every single plot point touched on leads so perfectly into the next two books. It\\'s the center for the true theme of the book that love triumphs over evil every time, no matter what, without fail. Loss is inevitable, but love carries those people with you forever. I love that this book truly begins that story for Harry. That he takes it on so selflessly.\\n\\nI love that this is where Neville Longbottom\\'s arc begins. He\\'s unmatched in his perseverance, and he\\'s the highlight of this book. We are only as strong as the people who teach us to be ourselves, and I\\'m so glad that Neville has Harry. I\\'m so glad that Harry has Lupin. And I\\'m so glad they all have Professor McGonagall.'},\n",

One of the ones dealt with in Order of the Phoenix continues to be the mechanics of racism (in this case the (hypocritical) hate of Muggles by Voldemort & Co. The way that Rowling builds this up is a great study in terms of how both Jews in Europe and blacks in the US have been vilified and how even the rare Jew or black can adopt the oppressive mindset due to their own self-hate and just ignore the contradictions. Similarly, the treatment of house-elves which Hermione has so persistently fought for (and for which Ron has consistently teased her becomes a key element to the tragic climax of this particular novel.\\n\\nOn to the Half-Blood Prince...\"},\n",

Yes Harry is angsty. Yes it's a tad bit whiny. But after having read the whole series, while Goblet was the turning point, Order of the Phoenix was where we saw the universe change and set the course for the rest of the series. PLUS it's the book that introduced Luna Lovegood!!!! How could it not be a great book???\\n\\n\\n\\nSpoilers ahead for those who haven't read the series (and if you haven't I can't even with you). This takes place after the murder of Cedric Diggory and everyone is prepping to face the Dark Lord. Harry is often kept out of the loop, which doesn't help because he's feeling isolated as is. When the Ministry of Magic starts interfering at Hogwart's, things can only go down from there...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLove this book! Despite the shouty caps angst from Harry, this book is full of fun moments and information I missed the first time around. It's also Harry's book of disillusionment, with Dumbledore and the memory of his father. There were also giant hints at Snape and Lily in this one that are so much more obvious now...\\n\\nI loved getting to know more about Neville, dear sweet boy he is. I kind of want a spinoff series from his point of view, kind of like Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow. Plus I loved that we get to know Ginny a bit more in this book too, now that she's not afraid to talk in front of Harry.\\n\\nAnyways, love this book. I recommend y'all read it or reread it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow me on ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥\"},\n",

       "    'review': \"“Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.”\\n\\nThe last two chapters of this book are heart-wrenching.\\n\\nThis book may not be perfect, but it was inching its way toward that finish line. I enjoy comedic, childlike humor as much as the rest of the fans, but to me when the story gets a little darker (deeper), it gets even better.\\n\\nWe get a return of favorite characters, but as with the other books, we also get new ones. While the rest of the series introduced new characters that were fun and that we actually wanted to read about, here it just seems like two main hate-filled creatures show up: Dolores Umbridge (shudder) and Bellatrix (who I can't stand.)\\n\\nHarry is now 15 and showing it through teenage angst and mood swings. Happily this didn't bother me because - let's face it - these are dark times in the young wizard's life and him being happy-go-lucky would just be unrealistic. Plus the teenager hormones were already tweaked anyway because of his friends, Dumbledore, and the wizarding community basically ignoring him for a summer. Then you have the Voldemort strange triangle in his head, probably fueling that anger. I noticed when watching the movie that they played up the potential possession while in the book it was hinted as a possibility, left for the reader to muse about themselves and see what happens.\\n\\nHermione and Ron show considerable patience with their temper-triggered friend, becoming of all things, perfects in the school. It was an ironic touch for the series but would have worked just as well without it. Loony Luna is a delight because the girl is simply so strange, although the convenience of her character's connected to a newspaper owning father comes into play as well. There's Fred and George, who I always loved in the books but who seem lusterless in the movies - here they rocked with their unique style of misbehavior, especially when showing up a certain new villain.\\n\\nWhere this book shines character-wise is Neville, who is so awesome as a friend suddenly and co-fighter. There's a teary situation in the hospital, and how he stands by Harry (stuffed nose and all) in a fight later was heart-winning. Dumbledore finally gets to show us why he has such an awesome, badass reputation in the wizarding world, and I couldn't be happier with the two scenes that showed him flexing the magic muscle.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince Snape is a favorite of mine but only shows his face occasionally, it was a further delight that Harry had to learn Occlumency from the professor. The scenes were intense and, although a small subplot, mesmerized me. They showed a glimpse into the life of Harry's parents before he put them on a pedestal.\\n\\nCan we all agree that McGonagall is even more likable after this book? I didn't care about her the first few, but she keeps growing on me. Here she's amazing.\\n\\nSirius...ah, Sirius. This book shows even further that he is dependent upon Harry because he misses James so much and sees the father in the son. There was a sad scene in the fire where he withdraws from Harry a bit because he's disappointed. He spends much of the book frustrated and lonely, which was realistic and deep but depressing. I love their relationship, both without families but connecting to each other due to that.\\n\\nLet's wave aside the villain of Voldemort for this book, shall we? He's there, he's bad, but he's not that frequent and he isn't the one who really irritated readers in this one. Those badges go to the annoying Umbridge we all loved to hate and the evil Bellatrix. Umbridge is around for the majority of book, raising shivers of annoyance. Besides her arrogant attitude that made me want to slap her, there's the beyond disturbing punishment with that blood quill and poor Harry. It certainly brought a twisted touch to the series that was almost missing before.\\n\\nI hate to see Harry tricked at the end, but you can't keep a series real and have the character be perfect in predictions every time. The book misses that perfect finish line because there are too many lucky coincidences that come in handy and save the characters throughout fight scenes, but they were still imaginative and adventurous. It's a large book, 870 pages, and if you stand back and examine it, not a lot of action actually happens. Still, it's so easy to get sucked in and so hard to look away.\\n\\nThere's a heartbreaking, soul-slapping death that I don't think I'll get over. I knew it was coming, but couldn't remember the order from the movies when it would show up. Sadness! It was sudden and shocking and just awful. Harry's emotion afterwards was realistic and well done.\\n\\nJ.K. Rowling continues this series with talent, and the books really do keep getting better and better. A timeless series that should continue to bewitch future generations.\"},\n",

I actually like it.\\n\\nThe first three books were silly children’s books with the occasional really good part. Enjoyable, but hardly remarkable. The fourth was an excruciatingly boring book that was saved by its amazing ending. , on the other hand, is a great fantasy novel.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is finally a lot darker, the story is a lot more coherent, and several new characters, organisations, places and scenes add a lot of complexity.\\n\\nOne of the most important aspects is the expansion of Severus Snape’s character. One particular flashback made me understand all his actions (though not quite like him, at least not yet) and hate Harry’s sorry excuse for a father more than any literary character ever.\\n\\nThe wildly interesting Order of the Phoenix is (obviously) introduced, several of Sirius’ ancestors show up in various forms (including the absodamnlutely amazing Phineas Nigellus Black), Dumbledore is truly shining in this instalment and the final scenes in the Department of Mysteries top the whole thing off greatly.\\n\\nAll in all, the second half of the series has placed itself on a much higher level than the first, and I am fully immersed in it for the first time.'},\n",

       "    'review': 'The Harry Potter experience has little time for rest and relaxation, with this fifth book in the series. Things take a significant turn towards the dark and eerie, yet the story remains captivating as magic politics takes centre stage. What began with a boy wizard has become a fight for survival with the evil Voldemort appearing in strange and mysterious ways throughout the piece, even as many deny his presence. The reader will have to pay close attention to connect with all the plotlines that J.K. Rowling offers, though the dedication does not go unrewarded. Rowling surely has outdone herself here as readers push into what might be called the ‘maturation’ of the series, no longer short books that rely solely on humour. Perfect for those who want something more adventurous and without the guarantee of a happy ending!\\n\\nHarry has again been forced into a state of boredom all summer long. Still stuck living with the Dursleys, Harry must bide his time and hope the days pass quickly before it’s time to return to Hogwarts. While out one evening, Harry and his cousin, Dudley, are set upon by Dementors. Harry does the only thing he can think to do and accesses his magical capabilities, in direct violation of Ministry of Magic regulations. Harry is forced to attend a disciplinary hearing when his actions are made known, one that could cost him a spot at Hogwarts during his important Fifth Year!\\n\\nAfter an intense process, Harry is exonerated, but not before he learns of a secret society, the Order of the Phoenix. Created by his headmaster, Dumbledore, the Order is currently housed in the home of Sirius Black, who remains wanted by the Ministry. Harry’s eyes are opened to the inner workings of wizardry and the politics that keeps the Ministry of Magic at arm’s length.\\n\\nHarry’s return to Hogwarts brings a great deal of change. Not only is it Fifth Year, but the OWL exams await students, a set of tests that help streamline further educational and career aspirations. Plus, a new professor has joined the faculty, Delores Umbridge, who has strong ties to the Ministry. While Ron and Hermione are eager to see what the year brings, an ominous cloud hangs over Harry, not to mention the constant ache of his forehead scar.\\n\\nWhile Harry tells anyone who will listen that he had a run-in with Voldemort, many follow the Ministry line and deny that it happened, choosing to consider that Harry and Dumbledore are mad and seeking to steal the limelight. Leading the denials is Delores Umbridge, who does all in her power to break Harry down in secretive and destructive ways. The reader discovers the pains Harry must endure at the hands of Umbridge, who appears to be power hungry herself.\\n\\nAs the Ministry of Magic seeks to put Hogwarts in its place, they nominate Professor Umbridge as High Inquisitor, allowing her to vet and remove any on the teaching faculty deemed out of line. Umbridge is also given the iron fist to bring the students in line, putting Harry in her crosshairs from Day One. Harry and Umbridge clash repeatedly, which eventually leads to a monumental decision that could ruin Fifth Year.\\n\\nThrough a series of secret communications, Harry tries to explain himself to Sirius, who offers support but cannot come to the aid of his godson as effectively as he would like. Harry does the only thing he can do, rallying students who feel the squeeze of the High Inquisitor. The creation of Dumbledore’s Army is a protest movement that will pit Harry against the Ministry in a standoff like no other. Things go so far that one senior member of Hogwarts will have to pay the price.\\n\\nAs the OWLs approach, Harry must juggle his studies, his ongoing romantic interest in one of his fellow students, and a series of dark dreams that he cannot fully comprehend. He receives help from a completely unexpected source to help block his mind from the powers that Voldemort appears to be trying to push. The scar aches repeatedly, which can only mean that evil awaits, though no one is entirely sure when or how!\\n\\nAs Umbridge takes further control at Hogwarts, it is an epic battle over the future of the institution, as well as a clash of good versus evil. Harry and Voldemort are destined to collide, which could end badly for everyone. With Hogwarts in shambles, Harry can only hope that he will be able to wrest control back to the good side, or face likely expulsion for good. Then again, if he’s dead, school won’t matter at all!\\n\\nJ.K. Rowling offers her readers, young and old alike, a story full of excitement and thrills on every page. As usual, there are nuances that appeal to various reading levels, making the story highly intriguing.\\n\\nHarry Potter retains the protagonist role, always maturing and finding new way to show this to the attentive reader. There are moments of significant backstory to offer, should the reader be paying close attention between the action-filled narrative in the present. Rowling again addresses the scar and its symbolism, providing more for the reader who has surely come with more questions. The reader gets another look at the personal side of Harry’s life, talking about his romantic interests as a more regular concern. Balancing that with an important school year provides needed depth for Harry’s character. With added struggles related to Voldemort, Harry proves to be one character who refuses to turn stagnant. The reader also sees the morose side of Harry Potter, especially in the final section of the novel.\\n\\nRowling continues providing strong supporting characters for her readers, both individuals present throughout the entire series and those whose one-off status was specifically designed for this novel. The ever-evolving aspect of the story permits Rowling to add new perspectives to Hogwarts and focus on an ever-growing group of humans and creatures alike. There is some development in a handful of the characters, which helps contrast alongside the advancements that Harry makes and permits readers to see growth in their favourites.\\n\\nThis was another of the ‘truly complex novels’, books that exceed the basics of what I would expect Neo might want to handle. However, he has been devouring them with relative ease. This was the longer of all the books, but it needed every pages to hash out some of the more complicated plot lines that could not have effectively been divided over a few novels. I can only hope that this does/did not scare some readers away, as there is such an attachment to a number of the characters that can develop for the dedicated and attentive reader.\\n\\nThe book uses a strong narrative to push it along and leaves the reader wanting more with every chapter. Much is revealed in relation of the Ministry of Magic and some of its more nefarious plans, as well as the darker side of the Potter-Voldemort clashes. Both of these appear to be essential to understanding the larger story arc that Rowling injects into the narrative. I can see many of the truths unveiled in this book are to be important parts as the series progresses, so I am trying to stay alert. Longer chapters help build a deeper story and entertaining the eager reader. I cannot wait to see what awaits me in the final few novels, as Harry surely is not done learning about himself, his family, and his role in the larger Hogwarts/Ministry struggles.\\n\\nKudos, Madam Rowling, another stellar piece of writing. I cannot wait to see what else you have for your reading fans.\\n\\nLove/hate the review?
