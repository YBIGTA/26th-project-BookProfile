The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.\\n\\nSixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.\",\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book.\\nTwo reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote:\\nBecause Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I love this book because - despite being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* (*)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book.\\n\\nKatniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being \\\"Lover Boy\\\", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah...\\n\\n...Rue...Oh, Rue...\\n\\n\\nNow, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Whose\\nbrought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care.\\n\\nSuzanne Collins strictly follows the rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.\\n----------\\nI enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets .\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nSo I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Dystopian Perfection.\\n\\nIn a post-apocalyptic future, life has turned extremely hard. Fighting poverty and hunger every day, sixteen years old hunter Katniss does absolutely everything in her power to have enough for her defenseless little sister, and a barely lucid mother. Life is hard, yet not impossible, until the one fateful day arrives. Once every year, the ever vigilant all powerful Capitol of Panem celebrates for their entertainment the “Hunger Games”, a yearly tournament where a handful representatives of each district are forced to fight in a massive arena, to the death. In a sad turn of events, young Katniss will have to fight not only for herself, but for the future of her starving family.\\n\\nI think this series needs as much introduction as Lord of the Rings; but what the hey, old habits die hard. Maybe not everyone has read it, maybe not everyone has watched it, but doubt anyone has never heard of it at some point. One of the greatest dystopian fiction of all time, or at least one of the best-selling ones. A literature masterpiece? Hardly. One of the most entertaining ever? Quite possibly! Astounding world building and character development. Not a profound reading at all, but a plot perfectly balanced, fast paced and action packed; if you can withstand YA that is, and the triangle thingy. Along with Percy Jackson and Divergent, one of the pillar series that sparked my literary addiction. Highly Recommendable.\\n\\n*** Hunger Games (2012) is a superb adaptation, maybe as good as the book, if not better. Highly popcorn and re-watch worthy. I don’t normally reread, or feel the desire to; but lost count of how many times I’ve watched the movie on TV. It just never gets old, and is perfect, for what it is; really bringing the characters alive in a way a book never can, and few adaptations ever succeed. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson just marvelous in their roles, with an unforgettably heartbreaking performance by Amandla Stenberg as Rue too. Still, even a decade later I can never forget that Madge Undersee was left out of the adaptation; and the Tessera system hardly explained or mentioned; along with a few other minor things cut out. Not one of the greatest films but one of the greatest adaptations ever, hands down. One of those few cases where I think I ultimately prefer the movie rather than the book. Extremely Recommendable.\\n\\nTeam Peeta btw.\\n\\nAlso. Fatniss I’m scared! <3\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n:\\n[2008] [374p] [Dystopia] [YA] [4.5] [Highly Recommendable]\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n★★★★★ [4.5]\\n★★★★★\\n★★★★☆ [3.5]\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\nEn un futuro post apocalíptico, la vida se ha vuelto extremadamente dura. Luchando contra la pobreza y el hambre cada día, la cazadora Katniss de dieciséis años hace todo lo humanamente posible en su poder para tener lo suficiente para su indefensa pequeña hermana, y una apenas lúcida madre. La vida es difícil, pero no imposible, hasta que un día llega el fatídico día. Una vez cada año, el siempre vigilante y todo poderoso Capitolio de Panem celebra para su entretenimiento los “Juegos del Hambre”, un evento anual en una masiva arena donde un puñado de representantes de cada distrito son forzados a lugar, hasta la muerte. En un triste giro de eventos, la joven Katniss deberԕ luchar no sólo por sí misma, sino por el futuro de su hambrienta familia.\\n\\nCreo que esta serie necesita tanta introducción como El Señor de los Anillos; pero qué demonios, los viejos hábitos nunca descansan. Tal vez no todos lo hayan leído, tal vez no todos lo hayan visto, pero dudo que nadie no haya escuchado hablarlo en algún momento. Una de las más grandes ficciones distópicas de toda la historia, o al menos de las que mejor vendieron ¿Una obra maestra literaria? Difícilmente ¿Una de las más entretenidas jamás? Muy probablemente. Increíble construcción de mundo y desarrollo de personajes. No una lectura muy profunda en absoluto, pero con una trama perfectamente balanceada, rápida en el ritmo y cargada de acción; si podés soportar lo Joven Adulto claro, y el coso ese del triángulo. Junto con Percy Jackson y Divergente, una de las series pilares que encendieron mi adicción literaria. Altamente Recomendable.\\n\\n*** Los Juegos del Hambre (2012) es una sobresaliente adaptación, tal vez tan buena como el libro, sino mejor. Altamente digna de palomitas y volver a ver una y otra vez. Normalmente nunca releo, ni siento el deseo; pero perdí la cuenta de cuántas veces he visto la película por TV. Nunca se gasta, y es perfecta, para lo que es; realmente trayendo a la vida a los personajes de una forma que un libro nunca puede, y pocas adaptaciones llegan a lograr. Jennifer Lawrence y Josh Hutcherson absolutamente maravillosos en sus roles, con una inolvidablemente desgarradora actuación de Amandla Stenberg como Rue también. Igual, incluso una década después no puedo olvidar que cortaron a Madge Undersee fuera la trama; y el sistema de las Teselas apenas explicado o mencionado; entre otras pequeñas cosas que quedaron fuera. No una de las mejores películas pero sí una de las mejores adaptaciones jamás, sin duda. Uno de esos casos donde creo que en última instancia prefiero la película sobre el libro. Extremadamente Recomendable.\\n\\nEquipo Peeta por cierto.\\n\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n:\\n[2008] [374p] [Distopía] [Joven Adulto] [4.5] [Altamente Recomendable]\\n-----------------------------------------------\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I was forced into watching Mockingjay: Part II this weekend. To clarify, I watched the second part of the last Hunger Games movie without having read any of the books, without having watched any of the movies.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I was confused as fuck.\\n\\nSo many questions and thoughts ran through my mind as I watched the movie. Why is Peeta so thin? Did that huge-ass bruise really disappear from her neck the next day? Is Katniss to look like she's about to burst into tears at any given moment, or is that just Jennifer Lawrence? Woody Harrelson is in this movie? Hey, it's Margaery from Game of Thrones! Who's President Snow? What's a Mockingjay? Lesser Hemsworth is pretty hot.\\n\\nWell, you get the point. I know how the book ended and I still have no idea who anyone is, and neither do I know their names, with the exception of Peeta, Gale, President Snow, that Coin woman, and Katniss. Of course, knowing how the book ended means I probably should read the first book, so\\n\\nAnd it was good. It was really good. My sister was right (she usually is).\\n\\nWhat else can I say that hasn't already been said? I loved it. The world building was interesting (although it helps that I've seen what it looks like on the big screen), and Katniss is . One of the things my sister didn't like about the first movie is that the on-screen Katniss was different from her portrayal in the first book. I haven't watched that movie, but I kind of see how the screen portrayal of Katniss might have bothered her. Book-Katniss is strong, kick-ass without being a Mary Sue. She has a fierce love for her sister, and she is manipulative and cunning. She uses the prospect of romance to protect herself, she has no qualms about using people, and I love that about her.\\n\\nTime to watch Movie #1!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"A lot of things are troubling me about The Hunger Games. A lot of things which I more and more perceive and which are not solely connected with this book but with the metaphor behind the words. People attach themselves to fictional freedom without seeing what really something is and which unfortunately is here to stay because you can't wake a person who is pretending to be asleep. You can’t make a shift on a deeper level, if the only thing that attracts you to this book is – a vision of fight, retaliation and the outcome of freedom. Freedom of flesh.\\n\\nIn comparison to the freedom of and from your mind which is nowhere to be found.\\n\\nAnd this is why I detest this book, although detest is such a strong from the ego word. Because the whole purpose of this story is to show how people shouldn’t sacrifice their children for the better of their communities and with the positive outcomes realise that we are so much stronger and yada yada.\\n\\nTHE WHOLE PURPOSE of this book should be that there shouldn’t even be in the first place a need to sacrifice members of our society for some other people to be amused. And where after the battle of ''united'' people we heal and repair the damages for the better tomorrow. The society cancer of western civilisation thinking.\\n\\nHeal the damage, never heal the cause of it.\\n\\nBut then we wouldn’t be talking here about the same book. We would be discussing how humanity can help each other with being better, with taking responsibility and with being open to each other.\\n\\nAnd yet imagine this paradox we live in: better, as if the majority of population can even understand that we are in constant blood thirst to achieve peace. With war comes peace. While along the way we are trying to be better and safer. Yet most people deliberately choose to live on the utmost lowest level of their existence. In fear, frightened of itself.\\n\\nAnd people read books which are so extreme in their bullshit. And people connect with Katniss because she is the heroine. She has managed to outsmart the system. Instead of thinking that she was not even supposed be there in the first place. Because we live in society that does this to their children.\\n\\n''No, we don’t!''\\n\\n''We do...''\\n\\n''But children can learn how to fight.''\\n\\n''You teach them to fight for individual puppeteers. And instead of working on yourself, how to achieve your inner peace, you associate yourself again with the group because it feels better to be in the tortured crowd, instead of being alone and awakened.''\\n\\n''What are you talking about? It is just emo gibberish. Leave Katniss alone. And in the end, it is just a book. Why don’t you want people to read and educate themselves, does everything have to be deep and meaningful, can’t you just relax?''\\n\\nYes, everything has to be deep and meaningful since we are drowning in shit of meaningless and shallow. The system as it is, the plot of this book is just another evidence to show us how we are controlled. That we are left barren from our true selves which we only find in empathy, love towards each other and genuinely understanding that we are one and everything is one. But on this provincial&marginal&primitive&emotional level, so many took this book for granted.\\n\\nAnd the only reason I am writing this review here, the only reason I am giving it so much attention is to tell what is on my mind since it is so widely popular and since I have read it. And one of the main reasons why I can’t really keep things light and popsy is because so many things are already deep down in gutter light and popsy and mainstream. As if having money is any critieria for life, as if not having your own free will and education and information means nothing. And the other side of the rich coin is poverty with people who believe in symbols, who are sidetracked with religions, censured TV, economy and utter lack of information circulation.\\n\\nAnd a lot of people here are trying to disregard this review and want to reassure me that I am so terribly wrong. BUT, you have yet not seen what I am talking about and it is perfectly OK.\\n\\nSo I followed as well screaming Goodreads recommendations and I bought a book that is stupid, violent and written so plainly but of course written for vast masses so they can be touched by fake social awareness. Because it is fake, but most of all it’s tragic.\\n\\nAnd this is not a critique toward Collins, in my nature of a thinker and seeing her a person who shared her thoughts and which millions of people loved and connected with, I am still a firm believer that the general public just didn’t understand what she was talking about. And this is my silver lining. Because it has been like this throughout centuries and with the biggest thinkers of our civilisation. What they meant and wanted to show, is definitely not what most of the public projected.\\n\\nBecause the mainstream public is a group of sheep, not seeing anything properly, but following and like a Tarzan, screaming, don’t you dare stealing my Jane from me. As a metaphor, don’t you dare telling me these uplifting emotions are not true, when all in me about this book tells me that is correct and how people should live their lives.\\n\\nAnd if the mainstream likes it, uh, then definitely that is not what it’s true.\\n\\nIt is just a constant reminder how so many things are left unrecognised while these superficial stories which evoke cheap emotions are always so hugely praised. It could have been just a little story but never underestimate the obese octopus that is called In God And Country We Trust - code red mentality. Mentality of humans which are too ignorant, beautifully naive and untouched basically with what is means to be socially aware.\\n\\nAnd although this is a teen book, it is more deeply hurting and sickening because if you want to influence somebody, of course you will influence the children – and yet there is nothing that children can learn from it. They can learn some things, we all need little courageous Katniss, but on a deeper subtler level is it just an intravenous injection of more Nothing and more Numbing and more Disconnected.\\n\\nAt least they read is one of the arguments. And argument as fruitfull as at least they eat GMO food. One food for the blind intellect, other for the digestion which both results in basic survival without any interference of you in all of it. Because it takes courage and guts and a pinch of anarchy to stop, turn around and start questioning what is handed.\\n\\nFor me, the thought about giving this to a child is sickening especially because we live in this world where all the life criterias are upside down. Because a child will not learn how things are vile and disturbing because Katniss told them through her delusional and hyperventilating focus, but a child will learn about life’s cruelty, and it will be touched by it sooner or later, by questioning everything that is served in front of it.\\n\\nBecause if it is served somebody is earning money and you are just getting fatter and sicker.\\n\\nAnd the children will learn how to question if you teach them how to find not if you broadcast them the answers. Not if you teach them through aggressive examples and if you keep the nation in cold sweat especially if you are lucky enough to live in the countries where oppression is not the issue but consumerism, body image and mediocrity have you on the leash.\\n\\nI am astonished with a fact that around 75.000 Goodreads members read this book and that around 50.000 of them rated it 5 stars. What is it that fascinates them so much.\\n\\nIt’s disturbing because people obviously associate and find themselves in this book. And it's about a girl Katniss Everdeen, living in the far away future, who was chosen to participate in a cruel Big Brother game, in which 24 contestants (children age 12-18) kill each other, because live TV has become demanding, and the public loves reality blood and violence. That's it. A little bit of undeveloped and unbelievable romance between her and two boys, a little bit of her abandoned family problems, a little bit of The 5th element movie political structure, mutants and pop stylists. It’s so screwed up.\\n\\nIn the beginning, first 50 pages were well written. There was suspense, Katniss was sweet and witty, but overall this book is a shitty meltdown. Adding the ridiculous cliffhanger ending. Some people here are using words like dystopian literature, and then write essays about how this book is the core of it.\\n\\nThe core is pointlessly graphic and sadistic, without any concrete message except of the negative: this book is just proving that the world today is fucked up if this book is so successful. I don’t see the point of reading about the fictional kids who are doing this to each other.\\n\\nIn a metaphorical way it is promoting political establishments of certain countries and that is getting tiring. Not all people are eager to swallow the shit of general brainwashing. Katniss being the heroine (ironical quote marks). Being loyal and darling and a role model. Just wake up. Life is happening and some pretty dark things are happening while you are thinking that Katniss is the representative of the club called liberation.\\n\\nFor me, in a bookish way it stands for one bad one night stand, kiss and forget. But as always, readers tend to bring fiction to their real life and just as many think that kittens and superheroes are comfort zones, a lot of readers perceive this plot as their own little shrine.\\n\\nBut that is me not being in tune with the mainstream population which is too distracted with billboards.\\n\\nBecause it is easier, because why protest, why not simply take what you are given - eat your GMO Monsanto's company hamburgers, eat your cancer giving Nestle products and think that The Hunger Games are the best franchise ever, like ever. If you don't have any arguments about real life activism and if you think that there is deepness in this plot which I have yet not seen so you need to enlightened me, just include North Korea or Hitler or ISIS(L) or those poor people who are closed in Zara hangers who work nonstop ''somewhere'' in the world because obviously you are aware of the crisis although you don’t think you could show on the map but you have heard somewhere on Murdoch media.\\n\\nThis shit sells. It's genuinely bad but excellently targeted. You know, it evokes pride and loyalty and massacring children, freedom and scandal and Hollywood. It goes very well with all the Kardashian filth. As long as it sells, sells, sells. And marketing agencies know that people are united when they are jealous, when they want and they with those hamburgers want freedom. Nobody is going to kill their Katniss in a goddam book! Really? Take a look around you.\\n\\nAnd then the punch line for this book comes from the so called activism from the shopping mall. People who devour literature of this kind and think that everything is all right while in the same time, fuck, you are getting oozingly fat.\\n\\nBottom line.\\n\\nThis book is very shallow and MTV culture oriented, like a classical example of easy consummated pop-literature; I'm very surprised that it didn't come with some trash magazine subscription. If it doesn't have savage brutality, prize money and prefix ''media coverage'' then it won't be appealing and educational because surely this is how children of 21st century survive this techno media world; through examples of true moral issues and realistic outcomes. Have another gulp of Coca-Cola along the way while you listen to dubstep shit.\\n\\nIt saddens me when a violent hillbillish book is so popular. What is there to truly identify yourself with. Except if your chicken soup for soul are basic emotions which come with buy 1 get 1 free.\"\n",

I felt such nostalgia, happiness, and hope between these pages, and I already can’t wait to revisit this story again. Also, again, this review will have , so use caution if you don’t want me to tell you what happens in each chapter of this book!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis first chapter really starts off with a heartbreaking bang. We quickly learn so many characters, but we even more quickly learn what type of character Katniss Everdeen is. The basic premise of this tale is that there are twelve districts and once a year each district will select two young candidates to fight to the death in a game, which will also be broadcasted for the world to see. Every year, a teenagers name gets added once to this random selection pool, but each year they get older another time their name gets added. Also, you can add your name more times to get food and supplies for your family, and this is very much the norm for most children. Katniss’s sister, Prim, only has her name in the drawing once because it is her first time, where Katniss has her name added over twenty times. Yet, you see where this is going…\\n\\n\\nOnce Prim’s name is pulled, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place in the games. Meanwhile, the boy contestant is Peeta Mellark, who Katniss remembers giving her bread when her family was starving after the death of their father. Together, they are thrown into a competition that no one believes they will be able to come back alive. Especially since only one victor is allowed, therefore one of them will most certainly have to die.\\n\\n\\nKatniss is given her iconic mockingjay pin that will literally change the world as she knows it.\\n\\n\\nHaymitch punches Peeta to make him look rougher, lol. The journey Haymitch is about to take alongside these two kids as their mentor, whew.\\n\\n\\nCinna (my favorite character), makes Katniss a fire dress in which the world has never seen, and will be the first time the world finds it extremely hard to forget her or her name. Also, unknown to Katniss, a start of a public romance is brewing with Peeta to help their image. We also get to meet President Snow and start to get a vibe of all the evil things he has been stirring up for some time now.\\n\\n\\nKatniss and Peeta make it to the training center and they start to learn about the other candidates from the other districts. We also get to learn about the different privileges of the other districts, and how some of these candidates view this as an honor to volunteer their life for (without needing to save a little sister). We also get to see Rue, and it’s really hard to not feel like you want to reach into the pages and protect her yourself.\\n\\n\\nKatniss makes quite the impression with an arrow and an apple, that many important people of the Capitol find very hard to ignore.\\n\\n\\nThis is the start of the Peeta versus Gale debate, and the brewing of a very opinionated love-triangle. For me, personally, I always think it’s obvious in Katniss’s inner monologue that she only likes Peeta, but I digress.\\n\\n\\nWe get to meet Caesar Flickerman and see Katniss and Peeta’s vastly different interviews with him. Peeta is coached to very much play the star-crossed lovers card, and he even tells Caesar that he loves Katniss more than anything.\\n\\n\\nThis is the start of Part 2, where they games are finally going to begin. And Cinna says my favorite line in the entire series to Katniss. So simple, so beautiful, so heartbreaking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe twenty-four tributes are entering the game, and in the middle is a cornucopia filled with weapons and supplies… if you are brave enough to make a run for them. Peeta distracts her at the very start of the game, so Katniss doesn’t go for the bow. And we quickly see that people are starting to form groups to take out some of the weaker players.\\n\\n\\nKatniss is proving that she will do whatever it takes to survive.\\n\\n\\nKatniss is still up in a tree, surviving, when she sees Rue and they form a silent plan together.\\n\\n\\nShe does get the medicine she needs from someone out there watching her in the world, who is rooting for her and her life. After with the help of some killer, engineered wasps… she is able to get down from this tree and gets a bow.\\n\\n\\nKatniss teams up with Rue, while they come up with a big plan to make it a little harder for the districts teaming up with all the supplies.\\n\\n\\nYeah, Katniss blows up the whole cornucopia.\\n\\n\\nYet, while Katniss and Rue are trying to meet up again with their mockingjay signals, Rue gets killed by a spear. Katniss sings to her, and realizes that nothing will be the same in her life again, no matter how long she has left.\\n\\n\\nKatniss is trying to deal with the hurt and pain and loss as best as she can, but she also is very hard of hearing in one of her ears now. And she also knows that Peeta has been wounded and is missing.\\n\\n\\nBut beyond all else, Katniss is a tracker and a hunter, and she quickly looks for Peeta at a water source and finds him. They also share a kiss when they find shelter, and she vows that she is not going to let him die.\\n\\n\\nThis chapter has some beautiful foreshadowing of giving Peeta some berries.\\n\\n\\nBasically, at this point, each contestant needs a certain supply very badly, so they place the things they need back in the middle of the map, and Katniss goes to retrieve theirs. She does get very injured in the process but makes it back to heal him. Thresh helped Katniss because of what she did for Rue.\\n\\n\\nPeeta takes care of Katniss and they get more care-packages because they are now the Capitol’s OTP and everyone is rooting for them and their romance.\\n\\n\\nThresh dies, and it breaks my heart every time because I highkey always root for him too. District 11 just deserved better. Cato is still alive, still the biggest threat, and still hella annoying. And then we have some more berry foreshadowing when a girl dies eating some.\\n\\n\\nNow that there are only three people left (Katniss, Peeta, and Cato) the game makers want them to finally put an end to the 74th Hunger Games once and for all. Kato runs at them, while wolves start running after them.\\n\\n\\nAnd we quickly find out that the wolves are none other than the people who died in the games. Well, I think at least. They for sure have the tributes eyes, and it just makes it extra freaky. But basically, after some fighting and some monologues, Kato is dying to the wolves slowly, but Katniss puts him out of his misery. They were promised earlier that if Katniss and Peeta were the final two of the game that they could both win and live, but now the game makers are trying to change that game right before them. And since they are saying there can only be one victor, Katniss takes a risk with those beloved berries and her an Peeta threaten suicide before all the people watching from the comfort of their own homes.\\n\\n\\nBut because they need a winner, they decide two is better than none, so they both are able to live. Katniss wakes up in a hospital where her body is healing and she is able to hear out of her one ear again. She gets to see Cinna, and believe that maybe their lives will be normal again. But Katniss quickly realizes that the Capitol is terribly upset that she played with them, and they are not going to ignore her actions in the game.\\n\\n\\nKatniss gets to see Peeta again, and they are forced to watch all the deaths that happened in the game during their winner’s interview. They both have taken so much damage physically and mentally, and they know that Snow is not through hurting them, or the people they love, by a longshot.\\n\\n| | | | |\\n\\nfor loss of a parent, animal death(s), abandonment, depression, PTSD depiction, blood depiction, alcoholism, gore, violence, and murder.\\n\\nBuddy read with & ! ❤\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I read this when it was first published, ordering it before I knew it was YA, and years before any films (which I've not seen). If I were a teenager or recommending this to a teen, I might give it 3*; as an adult, I give it 2*.\\n\\nPLOT\\n\\nIt's a potentially exciting but gruesome story, but most of the characters were rather flat, and much of the plot was predictable, partly because it's not hugely original. See Shirley Jackson's , which I reviewed , and the Japanese . Furthermore, there were too many flaws in the plot. I fail to understand its very high ratings.\\n\\nPost-apocalyptic America (Panem) is divided into a wealthy and technologically advanced Capitol and twelve subsidiary districts of oppressed people who exist in dire poverty, with inadequate food, housing, and health care and hardly any technology. To reinforce the power of the Capitol by instilling fear in the population, once a year, two children from each region are selected by lots to fight to the death in a reality show. If that were not bad enough, the whole thing is utterly corrupt in multiple ways, plus the public bet on the outcome, and sponsors can sway the results. Did I mention these are ? (Some are as young as 12, though the narrator is 16.) A compulsory full-body wax on a teen seems rather pervy and who would want to bet on, let alone sponsor a child-killing tournament, even if it's by helping one of the contestants? As the book keeps reminding readers, one person's survival is only possible by the death of the others.\\n\\nCRUELTY TO CHILDREN\\n\\nI realise that horrendous things are done to children around the world every day (extreme poverty, child soldiers, sexual assault, genital mutilation etc), but in none of those cases is the that but one child dies, and nor is it organised by the for a sick combination of sport, entertainment, punishment and profit.\\n\\nHumans often lack compassion, but I was never convinced by Collins' world - especially the fact this outrage has continued for (it's the 74th games), apparently without the Capitol even needing to invoke gods or supernatural powers to justify their cruelty! Could a barbaric annual tournament really be such a powerful incentive not to rise up in all that time? (I don't think so.)\\n\\nBIG ISSUES\\n\\nNevertheless, it tackles some big themes that are particularly pertinent to teens: the nature of friendship; divided loyalties; the difference between love and friendship; who to trust; whether the ends justify the means; the need to repay favours; the danger of power, wealth and celebrity; the corrupting influence of reality TV; the need for independence, and whether you can trust a parent who abandons you.\\n\\nIt all feels rather laboured to me, but it might not if I were a teen, which only reinforces my puzzlement at the number of adults who have enjoyed it. I must be missing something.\\n\\nNARRATIVE STRUCTURE\\n\\nNearly half the book is backstory and preparation for the games; the remainder is a tale of hunter and hunted. I predicted the main plot twist less than a quarter of the way in (and the fact that Katniss is telling the story limits the possible outcomes), but the suspense was broken when it was made explicit way before the end. There are some other twists between then and the final page, but by then I was rather annoyed with the whole thing.\\n\\nIMPLAUSIBILITY AND INCONSISTENCIES\\n\\nI'd enjoyed the book more, I would have found it easier to suspend my disbelief, but as it was, I was constantly irked by questions and inconsistencies.\\n\\n* The contestants (and their parents and grandparents) have been forced to watch the games every year of their lives. I suppose they had become inured to it, but on the other hand, that meant they the horror of it. I just didn't believe there was as little fear in them as there appeared to be - given that they are children.\\n* Participants don't want other participants to know where they are, yet sponsor gifts occasionally drop out of the sky, via silver parachute; not a risk, apparently.\\n* It's all filmed by numerous invisible floating cameras (I can buy that), but that somehow includes filming inside a cave that is virtually sealed (I can't).\\n* How (and why) would any of these participants be able to measure time to within half hour intervals?\\n* How big is Panem? It can only be a tiny part of the USA because each district specialises in only one thing (coal mining, agriculture etc) and has just one town square that can accommodate everyone (8,000 people in District 12) and yet it's a day's train journey from District 12 to the Capitol. It doesn't seem like a very plausible settlement pattern in a post-disaster world, even given the totalitarian regime (concentrating people in a few centres makes it easier to observe and perhaps control them, but it also creates more opportunities for opposition movements to develop).\\n\\nCOMPARED WITH LORD OF THE FLIES\\n\\nThere are some similarities with \\\"Lord of the Flies\\\" (my review here: ), but although \\\"The Hunger Games\\\" is likely to have more appeal to modern teens, I think there are (at least) two crucial differences:\\n\\n* In LotF one person's survival is not necessarily at the cost of everyone else's. (It is even possible that they could all survive.)\\n\\n* LotF has much more depth and symbolism: it tackles original sin; the mystical \\\"Beast\\\"; leadership, tribal allegiance and group dynamics (including bullying and attitudes to difference and minor disability) and the importance of ritual and belief.\\n\\nThe second point is what makes LotF a better book, in my opinion.\\n\\nOf course, there are other, more obvious, parallels with extreme \\\"reality\\\" shows such as \\\"Survivor\\\" and \\\"I'm a Celebrity, get me out of here\\\", but the fundamental differences are not just that contestants in those shows do not fear for their lives, but that they are adults who have to enter.\\n\\nI TRIED TO ENJOY IT!\\n\\nAny fans who read this will now hate me. I wanted to enjoy this book, and I read it all the way through, making notes as usual, but to no avail. Sorry.\"\n",

And may the odds be ever in your favor.”\\n\\n\\nis it crazy to say that this is my first time experiencing this universe? i personally feel like it is. i’m terribly late to the party. it seems like everyone has read the books and/or watched the movies and i’m the only person on the face of earth who didn’t have this phase. i was just a kid a decade ago and i don’t remember much, but i do recall seeing the way people were obsessed with when the movies came out. everyone was going crazy about it — but me? well, frankly, i was not interested in it and i’ve never felt the urge to watch the movies or read the books. it was just not my thing back then, and now i regret that because i bet it was so fun to be a fan at that time.\\n\\nbut hey, after a decade (more than that, actually) i’m finally here! you know what they say... better late than never. now enough with the small talk; let’s get into it, shall we?\\n\\nso... everyone knows what it is about (even me, who haven’t read the books or watched the movies) but i must say that the premise of the games where 23 teenagers aged 12-18 are forced to fight to the death and only one of them can survive is intriguing and obviously insane (irrelevant, but i’m a hundred percent sure that i would be the first one to die if i were there, there’s no chance i could survive). and the fact that it’s a televised event? what the hell... the whole thing is absolutely vile when you stop to think about it. but even though it’s brutal, and also sort of predictable in a few aspects, it’s undeniable that it’s entertaining to read.\\n\\ni’m not fond of dystopian novels. in fact, this was my first one, so i didn’t know what to expect and i was a bit hesitant that i wouldn’t like it. thankfully, turns out i ended up liking it and finding it interesting. although i have to admit that i was kind of confused with some stuff (i’m not kidding when i say that not even 20 pages in i was already lost) but i was honestly expecting that since it was my introduction to a new genre.\\n\\nit took me awhile to get into the story given the fact that it was slow at the beginning, but i got hooked once the pace picked up and i started growing attached to the main characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni believe we can all agree that is a badass. i mean, how could we not? such an icon. i must say that i adore reading books with female main characters like her.\\n\\nanother admirable thing about her is that she’s willing to do whatever it takes to protect and make sacrifices for the people she loves — especially her younger sister, Prim. given her father’s death and her mother’s depression Katniss had to take on the role of protector for her sister and, on top of that, she had to be the provider for their family. not the responsabilities someone from her age should be having of course, which is undeniably sad, but i admire how strong and selfless she is above all. if it wasn’t for her selflessness, she wouldn’t even be part of the 74th Hunger Games; Prim was the one who was chosen during the reaping, but Katniss decided to sacrifice herself and take her place because she couldn’t bear the thought of her little sister facing the cruelty of these games.\\n\\nKatniss is not perfect, she’s a flawed character who can be annoying at times, but given the circumstances, we can totally understand why she acted the way she did and i don’t think we should be too harsh on her. and besides, she’s a teenager who’s just trying to survive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnow, about ... see, i’ve always seen people saying he’s perfect and that he’s the ultimate boyfriend, but i was like “” but oh silly me, how i was wrong! you guys weren’t exaggerating, he deserves all the hype he gets. what’s not to love about him? he’s so kind, sweet, thoughtful, funny and easily loveable. i have a thing for MMCs who are cinnamon rolls so it’s not much of a surprise that i fell for him. i wish we got more of his personality, though. i didn’t feel like he was a well-explored character in certain aspects. either way, i liked him and i’m glad that meeting him was not a disappointing experience.\\n\\nbut, generally speaking, i don’t think the romance was exactly what i wanted. sure, it was good, but not awesome, you know? and i can’t say i am super obsessed with their relationship; not as much as i wanted to, at least. don’t get me wrong, i did love their dynamic and if you check out my updates you’ll see me fangirling over them, the thing is that i just felt like something was missing overall and i was also expecting much more. probably because of all the hype surrounding them. though i think that in some way i can understand the reasons behind that — romance isn’t really the most important thing here, is it? and besides, this is the first book, and i have two more books to read so i believe (and hope) that Suzanne will develop their relationship more and surely my feelings will be a little different by then. all that being said, are cute and that’s something i’ll never deny.\\n\\nand since we are on this topic, i need to ask an important question: where is the love triangle? i’m very confused, guys. the chemistry between Katniss & Gale was nowhere to be found here and, at least so far, i don’t understand at all why people like and choose Gale. he’s kind of bland, sorry. but well... let’s see what happens next, maybe it’s too early to make assumptions. whatever happens, though, i won’t switch teams. and i’m sure about that. what can i say? won me over.\\n\\nanyways, moving on... as you might have noticed, i mentioned a few complaints throughout this review and there are other things that prevented me from giving it a high rating.\\n\\nfirst of all, this didn’t meet all of my expectations. it was a great book and i did like it, but i had over the top expectations and, unfortunately, some of them weren’t met. i was expecting to finish this book and be like “” but that’s not quite what happened.\\n\\nalthough this book was enjoyable for the most part, there were lots of parts that were monotonous to me and there were also some things that i would change if i had the chance.\\n\\ni started losing a bit of interest in the last couple chapters. i can’t pinpoint why, though. i was just not having much fun anymore and that was one of the main reasons why i couldn’t rate this story higher.\\n\\nthe ending was not precisely what i wanted. i was expecting something satisfying and perhaps more intense, but that’s not what i got. i was disappointed.\\n\\nbut keeping all my complaints aside, . it offers a relevant, interesting and well-written story with remarkable characters that are easily captivating, so of course i think everyone should read it at least once. if you haven’t read it yet, what are you waiting for? go for it.\\n\\ni will continue the series and i’m extremely excited to do so! i literally can’t wait to see what the next book will bring — hopefully something better that will exceed my expectations. now, please excuse me while i go watch the first film. 🏃🏼‍♀️\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n─────────────────────\\n\\n\\n\\ni know i’m super late to the party, but i’ve finally decided to start this series and i can’t even express how excited i am! let’s see if it’ll live up to my expectations. 👀\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"For a long time now, I’ve wanted to rewrite my review of The Hunger Games so that I could tell you why I don’t just love this series, but why I also think it’s important. It is beautiful for the unflinching way it shows you, as a reader, your own willingness to disregard people who are different from you - how you are the Capitol audience. But, it is important as a story about girls. I had not initially thought about articulating that point because it seemed so obvious to me, and I am bad at recognizing my own assumptions. Lately, though, I have seen so many people, both men and women, acting as though this remarkable book is a piece of fluff that I realized maybe what I love most about is not as obvious as it seems. To me, this series is important because it is a landmark departure from the traditional story about girls.\\n\\nToo often, stories objectify women. But the word “objectify,” I’ve realized, has almost no meaning for someone who has either not experienced objectification or who hasn’t really recognized it in her own life, so I’m going to be more descriptive here. When I say stories objectify girls, I mean they that sometimes have handy dandy extra gadgets such as an and .\\n\\nSidebar: if you are inclined to now google the word \\\"fleshlight,\\\" I encourage you to consult the before doing that, as the google results will probably be NSFW and also NSF those of you whose parents might check your browsing history. Do parents know how to do that? Sorry for the sidebar, I am just intending to make an explicit point, and now I am feeling uncomfortable about what that explicit point might mean to the target audience of this book. Girls, you are probably badass like Katniss, and you are definitely a fleshlight.\\n\\nBack to my rant about typical objectification in storytelling: often the fleshlights have . Sometimes they have , and other times they work as for or or . A lot of times, I will hear people refer to this type of objectification as treating women like they are just a vagina, or a pair of boobs, but I think there is something to the stories that is less human and more sexbot machine than that complaint covers.\\n\\nSo, in all of those links, I have tried to include books written by men and by women because I think that women think of ourselves this way almost as often as men think of us this way. The link from , for example, shows both a man and a woman treating women like fleshlights. I have also included both books I love and books I hate because, ultimately, I do think girls adopt this story about themselves, and I also think we can pretty easily identify with a male protagonist and disregard female characters who look nothing like humans. For example, is one of my favorite books in the whole world, even though it does not contain any women who resonate with my experience of humans. And I don't think it's necessarily bad that I can enjoy stories where women are only fleshlights, as long as I can still be whoever I want to be without a positive role model. I think it's good to enjoy stories and take what we can get from them, and so I don't regret that I love .\\n\\nIn seeing some male reactions to , I am reminded that most men do not identify with female protagonists the way women have been trained to identify with male protagonists. This seems like a huge disadvantage for men to be in, to me, and if you are a man reading this review, I would ask you to check out your bookshelves. How many female authors are on your shelves? How many of the books those authors wrote have no central male character? If you have a minute after that, check the shelves of a woman you are friends with and see how many of her books were written by men or have no central female character. Odds are the results will be pretty different.\\n\\nis such a groundbreaking and deliberate example of a woman’s perspective on war and family and even men that it floors me. I think it partly floors me because, other than , I can’t think of another example of a female character who really fights for herself in such an obvious and hopeful way. Katniss is strong and broken, and powerful in her brokenness. Collins’s image of a woman’s perspective is not, admittedly, as effortless as Moira Young’s in , but its deliberateness has its own value.\\n\\nIt is not an accident that the story shows Katniss’s emotional growth and that Peeta, as a more emotionally whole person, facilitates her emotional growth. It is not an accident that the story does not discuss the effect Katniss has on the erectness of Peeta’s and Gale’s penises. The first is not an accident because in reality, men do not have to be the emotional cowards that the stories I’ve linked to above make them out to be. Masculinity does not have to mean emotional cowardice. The second is not an accident because the story is not from Peeta and Gale’s perspectives. Despite widespread rumors to the contrary, it is my experience that women pretty seldom think about their effect on men’s penises. Hopefully, we think of our primary purpose in life, in the way so many stories think of it, as making penises erect. Hopefully, we never think of ourselves as gadgets that are super fun for other people.\\n\\nThere are so many reasons I love series, and all of this is one I wouldn’t have initially even thought to say. I saw this Eleanor Roosevelt quote earlier this month, and it said, “It is better to light one small candle than to curse the darkness.” I think is a candle in the overall dark narrative of girls’ perspective on life. Yes, it is also a poignant critique of reality TV and Western callousness about the catastrophes caused by industrialization in the developing world, but that, too, resonates with me in many ways because of its remarkably feminine voice. It absolutely makes sense to me that this book is not for everyone because of its violence, but I still think that it is objectively important because it shows a perspective that seems authentically feminine to me – that talks like a girl, not like a sexy, fancy gadget. I’m not saying that in my opinion girls don’t or shouldn’t ever think about being sexy or erect penises, I’m just saying that it is my experience that we think and care about many, many more things than penises, clean houses, and food, and very, very few stories are willing to tell you about that. The is one that does, and it does so in way that is beautiful and important.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"It seems weird that I never reviewed The Hunger Games . I don't know why I didn't when it was a series that completely took over my life for a short while. But recently I've been thinking about posting something in this review space and after just watching the second film (which I think was amazing and better than the first), now seems like as good a time as any to talk about why I love Katniss and nearly everything about this series.\\n\\nI gave this book four stars back in 2011 and I'm going to leave that rating as it is because it's an indicator of my thoughts at the time (though they slightly differ now) - thoughts which were influenced by having just finished the fantastic, horrifying, brutal and unforgettable manga series. I don't think it was the best time for myself and Katniss to find one another when I had so much beautiful insanity to compare the book to, but it still managed to have such an effect on me that I instantly told every friend and family member to read it. Coming back to this now after having spent the last couple of years being bombarded with dystopian YA, I appreciate what Collins has achieved a whole lot more.\\n\\nI appreciate the strength of Katniss as a heroine who commands our attention and holds our love whilst still being what some would consider unlikable; I appreciate the balance of beauty and horror that Collins delivers on every page, treating us constantly to both the darkest despair and rays of hope; and I also - amazingly - appreciate the love triangle. Love triangles seem to have chased me and hunted me down with every YA read I picked up over the last two or three years - my dislike for romance instantly becoming doubled by the introduction of yet another boy with beautiful eyes. But Katniss, Peeta and Gale worked for me. They convinced me, held my interest and made me cry. The love triangle worked because it's outcome wasn't obvious, because we all wondered and hoped and worried.\\n\\nKatniss still remains for me everything that a female protagonist should be. Or a female hero, at least. She fights for the ones she loves, she's brave and doesn't need to be saved. But neither is she a one-dimensional smiling poster-version of a heroine. She falls, she fails, people get hurt because of her and she has to live with that. We love her and yet she's antisocial, awkward and moody. She loves other people with all her heart but she's not much of a team player. In short: she's a complex portrait of a young woman that doesn't fall into any neatly defined boxes or categories. Now, perhaps, authors have since tried to recreate her. But she's still one of the first and best.\\n\\nI know another review of this book isn't needed. I know you've all probably read it anyway. Or never will. But this isn't really for anyone else; it's a reminder to myself of why this book deserves its hype and why I need to remember to come back to it again and again between the new (and hopefully amazing) YA books I'll be reading in the future.\"\n",

I’ve already seen the movie, but the book is so much better.\\n\\nIn The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is scraping by, just trying to make her daily living, hunting by her bow in the forest to feed her family. Every year, The Capitol requires every district to offer up one boy and one girl as tributes. The tributes fight each other to the death until only one person survives.

Unfortunately, Prim, Katniss’s younger sister is selected. In an incredible act of bravery, Katniss volunteers to take her sister’s place. Will Katniss make it through The Hunger Games?\\n\\nFirst of all, the narrator on this was perfect. She even did the accent for the Capitol people, and she sang the song.\\n\\nSecond, The Hunger Games is a perfect dystopian novel. It has different dresses and customs, but it isn’t overkill or confusing.\\n\\nThere are also many parallels to today’s society. For example, why do the citizens allow The Hunger Games? Because they don’t believe that their children will be selected. How many people believe that they will never be unemployed, never get divorced, never become seriously ill or injured? People like betting on themselves. But we, as a society, aren’t we better off if we made sure that there were strong safety nets in place for those who happen on hard times?\\n\\nIn The Hunger Games, all is also not equal. The tributes can have sponsors who rain down much needed supplies on the tributes. We like to think that everyone has an equal opportunity. But is that really the case when the rich can purchase private ACT/SAT tutors for their children? What about those who start their first job and have strong allies and mentors from day one?\\n\\nBut I also loved this book, because it had many small acts of kindness.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith cruelty becoming commonplace, kindness stands out. When District 11 came together, I racked my brain trying to remember the last time that we, as a society, came together for a cause, and I came up short. I think the world is hungry for a rallying cry, a cause that we can all fight together for. What would the world be like if the cruelty was replaced by kindness? Full disclosure: may have cried just a little bit reading this.\\n\\nLooking forward to the next book in the series….\\n\\n- The Girl On Fire\\n\\n\\nJan A Town Like Alice\\nFeb Birdsong\\nMar Captain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De Berniere\\nApr War and Peace\\nMay The Woman in White\\nJun Atonement\\nJul The Shadow of the Wind\\nAug Jude the Obscure\\nSep Ulysses\\nOct Vanity Fair\\nNov A Fine Balance\\nDec Germinal\"\n",

I keep wishing I could think of a way to...to show the Capitol that they don't own me. That I'm more than just a piece in their Games.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, I really really liked this book!! Of course, I loved Peeta!How can I not? He is perfect!\\n\\n\\nBut Katniss? Why?? She is so strong and bad-ass but she always misunderstands Peeta! It's so obvious that he loves her but she is in denial! She is so stupid!! And when she realizes his feelings, she just hurt him! Congrats!\\n\\n\\n4 stars because of Katniss' stupidity!\\n\\n\\nLet's start from the beginning!\\n\\nWhat is Hunger Games?\\nEvery year, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 were selected from each of the twelve districts as tributes, who train for a week and then are sent into an arena to fight to the death.Only one tribute can win the games. This competition is showed to television to be seen by all citizens.\\n\\nSo, Katniss' little sister, Prim, is selected for the games, but Katniss took her place to save her.\\n\\nThe boy who was chosen to participate was Peeta Mellark, a boy who Katniss knew because she saved her from starvation and give her some bread as a result his mother beat him!\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n1) I loved Peeta! He protected her but I will admit she protected him as well! She risked her life to get the medicine needed to heal his leg. But how can she not see that he is madly in love with her? I loved it when he told her about her singing for the music class, that's when Peeta realized he was in love with her when he saw that the birds were listening like they did for her father.\\n\\n\\n\\n2)I think she has feelings for him deep down! Very deep.\\n\\nSometimes when she kissed Peeta she felt guilty because of Gale! Why????He is her best friend! At the beginning, she said that she never saw him that way and now what? She is confusing me.\\nPlease, not love triangle again!!I liked Gale but no!\\n\\n\\n3)Curiously, I liked Haymitch! He won the Hunger Games of his time. He is also Katniss' and Peeta's mentor. It seems at first that he doesn't like Katniss very much but at the Hunger Games he helped her more than he helped Peeta.\\n\\n\\n\\n4)I also liked Cinna, their stylist. He always supported her in his way.\\n\\n\\n5)Rue! She was the 12-year-old female tribute from District 11. I really liked that Katniss allied with Rue. They were amazing together. But Rue died.\\n\\nI understand only one can win( our case two) but I felt so sad when she died. Not only her though. A lot innocent kids die because of the Capitol. It's not fair.\\n\\n\\n6)In the half of the games, it was announced that two tributes from the same district can win. So katniss and Peeta can be allies. But when all the other tributes died it was announced that the rule they said early has been canceled. I was so angry! They did it on purpose. Assholes!!!\\n\\n\\n7)When they announced it, Katniss aimed her bow at Peeta when she sees he has picked up a weapon, but he throw it into the lake. She is so stupid. He didn't want to fight her and she thought that he could kill her.\\n\\n\\n8)I was scared when Peeta and Katniss threaten to commit double suicide so there will be no winner! But it was a trick. Thankfully, that trick worked and both PEETA AND KATNISS WERE WINNERS!\\n\\n\\n9)And the ending! Peeta discovers that Katniss was mostly acting during the games about the feelings. He was so heartbroken! My baby!\\n\\n\\n\\nP.S. I haven't seen the movie yet!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"In around 100 A.D., Roman poet Juvenal wrote that ‘everything now restrains itself and anxiously hopes for just two things: bread and circuses.’ How true and terrifying these words are to remain relevant through the ages and how succinctly they get to the heart of Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games. Published in 2008, this novel introduced the world to its harrowing heroine, Katniss Everdeen, whom Collin’s has describes as ‘’ volunteering herself to be sent in sacrifice for the entertainment of others in order to protect her sister and taking not only it’s fiction world of Panem by storm but the real world as well. The novel launched into a trilogy and subsequent prequels with the newest slated to arrive next year, has been translated into 56 languages and by the time the first film adaptation arrived in 2012 it had already sold nearly 18 million copies. Yet somehow I have never managed to read the books until now despite rather enjoying the films though after some prodding by my daughter I have finally entered Collins arena and I have to admit…this was incredible. This book practically launched a decade of dystopian novels as popular fiction and helped bring the YA genre to prominence, though I wouldn’t even say this is a teen novel but a novel simply anyone could enjoy across the spectrum of ages. Perfectly plotted for maximum tension and intrigue and quite brilliantly written, this is practically impossible to put down as it brings hit after hit of action, terror and sharp social criticism. A novel of an obdurate authoritarian government and wealthy class upholding power through propaganda, division, lack of resources and public displays of violence, shows the ripples of unrest begun through the actions of a bold heroine with ‘’ to break through the public control of Juvenal’s ‘’ May the odds be ever in her favor.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nAt this point the story to is practically common knowledge and culturally embedded the way one need not give a description of what, say, or is about. Collins perfectly amalgamates narratives explored in stories such as or with early 2000s channel surfing and rise of reality television into a violent, dystopian world. I’ve always said marketing is simply the marketable term for propaganda and takes this to an extreme level. Their futuristic gladiator-esque battles pitting children from each District of Panem in a brutal contest of survival becomes a sort of reality-television yearly event that keeps the districts in line reminding them of the cost of rebellion while also keeping them at odds with one another, broadcasted as entertainment in such a way as to make one think of ’s warning that ‘’ The Game’s have a sinister marketing mechanism to them, the ‘’ half of Juvenal’s prophetic words.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nPlucked from their impoverished conditions and brought to the Capitol and put on display for people to pick favorites and become sponsors for (not unlike politicians begging for donations and trying to get corporations to fund them since in the US a person is capped at around $3k in donations but corporations can give endless money), not for the sake of humanizing them but, more insidiously, to give the impression of humanizing them while actually making them into a . The sort of character you can become attached to without having to feel any authentic sadness over their death, the type of character you can enjoy from afar without having to confront the reality of their mortality and personhood. ‘’ Katniss has to grapple with, ‘’ Which hits hard in the age of algorithms and brands pretending to be people on social media, but in the Games it means if the children aren’t murdering each other sensationally enough they’ll send a fireball at Katniss so the slogan “the girl who was on fire” gets a little more traction to sell sponsorships. Little did they realize that very slogan could take on a double meaning of resistance…\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nPerhaps this is from having seen the whole arc before reading the book but this read was a fascinating exercise in well-plotted foreshadowing with Katniss as a fairly unreliable narrator that has yet to become aware that her character building has been subverted as one of rebellion. Madge, the mayor’s daughter, giving her the Mockingjay pin is just the start of her transformation into a symbol and the slow-burn of scripted romance and showmanship is all aimed at showing ‘’ As my daughter pointed out, Panem is a total surveillance State and the randomness of the Games lottery—something that feels vaguely akin to 's (read in link)—is likely more marketing than actuality the way reality TV vet’s their contestants and the Capitol is far too horny for control to not hand-pick contestants for maximum profitablility under the fake guise of chance. The District 12 handlers have also had time to devise a quiet plan and use the flow of entertainment as a way to enact it as long as it is keeping ratings high and the public glued to there television. This, like all marketing (I have a degree in this almost entirely for the purpose of shit talking it), is best done by appealing to emotions (fear and religion, the latter of which is absent in Panem, being the two with strongest resonance) and employing psychological manipulation to make viewers/customers/etc feel they are making their own choices instead of being corralled, and by creating the character of Katniss they are playing into the marketing needs of the Capitol and the entertainment factors of The Games while also planting their own seeds of subversion in the highly fertile soils of public option. Here is where Juvenal’s ‘bread’ comes in.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nCollins pays special attention to food throughout the novel with bread having a very symbolic purpose. [] more like the HANGRY Games, am I right!? **elbows you in the ribs until you are assured therapy is in your future** Katniss’ own name and her father’s quip that ‘’ is key here too, as she becomes the symbol that gives hope in districts that are quite literally being starved while we see the juxtaposition of the Capitol’s wealth mainly portrayed through their absurd and frivolous fashion and lavish meals. Compared to the Districts, ‘’ when being fed and entertained is part and parcel of their access to wealth while being constantly reminded that those outside the Capitol are famished and those who betray them become an Avox with their tongues cut out serving out in the public eye so all can see and internalize the punishment. The public shows of violence are part of the way the Capitol keeps the masses down, coupled with their refusal to let the Districts communicate, dividing them and only allowing them to interact as rivals during The Games. As Juvenal said, control oomes from the circus—not unlike the way ’s was a world that, under the systematic drugging and entertaining by the State, controlled itself in order to avoid pain—but also bread and keeping a population starving in order to feed them as a reward is a fast way to ensure they line up and keep their heads down in order to receive the “good graces” of the State and look out for themselves to avoid punishment only further dividing them. Make life a “every person for themselves” situation and punish anyone in proximity to any crime and people will not unite. It is a union busting tactic and a reminder that family is on the line if you step out of line. When Katniss shoots an arrow at the onlookers out of frustration she is less scared for herself than what they might do to her family as punishment.\\n\\nThis isn’t just in dystopia either and there are a lot of real world examples in the US of this sort of thing. Look at the in Michigan’s Upper Penninsula, my own state, where management shouted “fire” in a hall being used for an employee christmas party to trigger a panicked stampede to punish workers for collective action—59 of the 73 people killed were children, the youngest being 2 years old—to send a message that uniting against the powers that be meant death of your family. Or, even more insidious, simple glossing over violence by distracting with gestures that seem positive but cede no power. Llook at how the was a way to put a good government marketing spin on lip service to the working class without any actual action in response to police opening fire and murdering strikers during the in 1894. Such tactics is exactly what the Capitol does, commit violence and then spin it to hold power.\\n\\nThis becomes rather pertinent during the Games when we see how the strong form collective action in order to mop up the weak. It’s like corporations, rallying together and funding politicians to ensure tax reform and policy that benefits them and only betraying each other “in the spirit of competition” once they are the last ones standing. Yet here we see a subversion. Peeta joins with The Careers in order to protect Katniss (trust issues are on high throughout this book) and there are some amazing moments when District 11 realizes they are far more aligned with 12 than the Careers. Its like the sayings on class solidarity people like to posture but rarely enact about how the middle class is far more aligned with the homeless and poor than billionaires but, as the Capitol propagates, all attention is turned towards serving the rich in hopes of being able to survive. I need to give a quick shoutout to District 11 though because they are wholly underrated in the series. Thresh is a real one and my favorite character and Rue is such a little sweetheart who deserved better and Katniss’ realization of this is quite a spark on the fires of rebellion. And how does District 11 thank her? Bread.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nLet’s talk about bread. Bread comes bearing a long history of symbolism. Breaking bread has a connotation of togetherness and unity. We have Jesus in the Bible making five loaves feed the masses, or breaking bread with his apostles as a symbol of unity. And this unity is present here too. Peeta, the sweet little Peeta who is FAR more interesting than the meek version of him in the films, brings Katniss bread when she, like Theseus, volunteers ‘’ to fight in the Games. It is an early symbol of unity replicated by the gift from District 11 after she places flowers on the body of Rue to humanize her death and show that even the deaths of the poor carry emotional weight. It is also a direct fuck you to the showy fashions of the Capitol to adorn the body of the poor with bright colors–bright flowers that will wither and die like the Districts are under their control.\\n\\nUnity becomes key here, and Katniss and Peeta’s collective action to eat the berries becomes the action that allows them to live. It will also become the action that President Snow fears is a spark of rebellion in but I’ve not finished it yet so more on that later. They lived by giving a marketable narrative the Capitol couldn’t spin fast enough. It is interesting to note, however, that the act of rebellion once again involves food and eating. Katniss earlier shoots an arrow through an apple, the apple in the mouth of a pig that fairly represents the way the children being sacrificed for the entertainment of the State, to ensure the Capitol pays attention to her. Even Haymitch’s alcoholism (beer being a product of yeast that nudges the symbol of bread yet again) is a show of indulgence in a world where indulgence is denied to the Districts, can be viewed as a small private rebellion. It also keeps the horrors of his past quieted, not that this condones alcoholism as a coping mechanism but you can see where Collins is going with that. Especially with lines like ‘’ and how we can hold on to our own small personal resistance.\\n\\n‘’\\n\\nwas an utterly fantastic book and engaging read far beyond what I had imagined it would be. It is fiery, it is relevant, it is smart, it is a whole lot of fun without sacrificing depth and insight. I liked it a lot better than the movies too, which tend to focus more of the action whereas the book kind of reminded me of the books I read as a kid where it focuses more on the survival aspects. It is a smart little book on the perils and powers of propaganda, the bread and circuses that keep people in line, but also a story about pushing back using their own tactics against them. A fascinating and fantastic book that lives up to the hype.\\n\\n\\n\\n''\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I LOVE THIS BOOK! I've said to a few people that if I wasn't married, I'd have to marry this book. :) I read the 400 page ARC in a less-than-24-hour time period (so quickly that it was never even on my \\\"currently reading\\\" shelf), which I've only done before with HP books, and I've just officially put the first book on my 2008 favorites shelf. I feel pretty safe in saying that if this isn't still my favorite book of the year when next January rolls around, that I'll eat a hat. As soon as I finished reading it, I turned around and read it a 2nd time, which I've never done before in my life. I loved all of Collins' GREGOR books, and think she's a wonderful writer, but she's ratcheted it up to another level with this one. Even though it's the first in a trilogy, this one definitely stands alone, and I'm not sure how she can keep it up for another 2 books, but I suppose it's possible (think: THE GIVER, although I loved GATHERING BLUE, and liked THE MESSENGER--HUNGER GAMES is much more brutal than THE GIVER, though). It's got some very meaty issues to chew on, not the least of which is reality TV taken to extremes. There's a chaste and unresolved romance (think: TWILIGHT, but I don't think I will make it past the first in that series--HUNGER GAMES has much more action, more of a plot, lots of well-developed secondary characters, as well as extremely likeable main characters. I will miss Katniss until I can read about her again.). What more could you possibly ask for out of a book? It doesn't actually come out until October 2008, but if you can get your hands on an ARC, definitely do! I think that the violence in this will be easier for kids to take, since they probably won't see it quite as clearly as an adult will. None of it is particularly graphic, but it is definitely brutal. This is on the edge of too dark for me, which is my favorite kind of book. There aren't many writers who can push it right to the edge for me without going over (Zusak comes to mind immediately), but Collins is definitely one of them. Another book that I loved, and think of to compare this to is HOUSE OF THE SCORPION, but that fell apart slightly at the end for me. HUNGER GAMES didn't lack anything at all for me. OK, I'll stop gushing. I may have to re-write this review when I get some perspective. (2012: Obviously, I never did rewrite it, and this is my most-\\\"liked\\\" review :)\\n\\nMy 10 1/2 yr old son asked to read this with me, so I read it for the 3rd time with him in Oct 2008. Still my definite favorite book of the year, but all the typos in the finished book were pretty disappointing. Still, it's my choice for just about any award out there, come January, including the JHUNT.\\n\\nUpdate May 2009: I am dying because the CATCHING FIRE ARC has just been released, and people are saying it's at least as good at HG. I've had 2 teenaged boys at my library read this on my recommendation, and both of them came back asking me for more books like it (really there isn't anything). One of them has pre-ordered CATCHING FIRE on Amazon (updated to say that I worked in a fairly disadvantaged neighborhood in DC at the time, so that was not a usual occurrence).\\n\\nMay-June 2011: I'm reading this for the 4th time, with my younger son, who's finishing up 5th grade. Still as good as ever!! Can't wait for the movie!!\\n\\nUpdate 2012: Between them, HG and CATCHING FIRE were the pinnacle of my 20-yr career as a YA librarian! I've seen the movie twice so far, and definitely liked it better the 2nd time, when it didn't have to try to be my favorite book. :)\\n\\nUpdate 2020: It's been 9 years since I last read this, but I've never listened to the audiobook, so I decided that having it read to me would be a good activity during the covid-19 pandemic. STILL as good as ever, and the odds will forever be in its favor.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Fantastically Written? Ooooh yeah! Compelling? Yup! Super Quick Read? Most definitely! Original? Um...well *shuffles feet, since I seem to be a rare non-five star-er* not original at all really....\\n\\nMan, I wish someone on my friends list here has also read Battle Royale and this book! The Hunger Games WAS pretty fantastic, hence the four stars (though I would have given 3 1/2 if the choice was available.) I ate it up, shouting into other rooms and offices that I was going to be shoving the book into their hands as soon as I was done, but as it went on desha vu was a little too common for me. I know there are major story types out there, ones that are repeated over and over again. Shakespeare retold 200 different ways. The bible reinterpreted to 2,000,000 varieties of tales....but when it comes to YA dystopia, which is by far my favorite genre of any book, originality is one of my main ways I judge a book. FEED felt utterly original. The world of UGLIES felt new. LITTLE BROTHER was just plain amazing. If it's going to be about \\\"the future\\\" we don't know about, make it original. In my mind dystopia novels survive on \\\"idea\\\" more than \\\"excecution\\\" and while the execution of this was beautiful, the idea was hardly new.\\n\\nWhile I have a really good feeling Collins never read, or maybe even heard of, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games was 90% the plot of Battle Royal, minus the guns, the extra blood, the ability to get to know all the other players. In Battle Royal (short explanation of BR plot: 40 students put on island forced to kill each other and winner is set for life and put on TV etc...), the main focus is a love story between two students trapped in the game, two students bonding together with no real urge to kill others...one of whom had a crush on the other forever and it is only revealed during the game. There are so many other similarities, from the ways the gamemakers manipulate, to the ways the media encourages, to one character having a fever and the other taking care of them with soup. There are even \\\"career\\\" battle royal players. In BR you see the emotions before and after someone is killed, their last thoughts, the feeling of the person who killed. It's actually really beautiful the way it is done, and so believable that put in an arena teens WOULD turn into savages. In The Hunger Games, yes the main characters were fantastic, and many of the lesser as well, but Foxface is only Foxface, and the Careers are never more than random 1-dimensional bad guys.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games was very Battle Royale, very The Long Walk (Richard Bachman book), and very much current reality shows. I am not saying it wasn't a GREAT read, I'm just saying it shouldn't shake the publishing earth the way I am pretty sure it is going to. I anticipate this is the next Twilight series people are going to gush over. In a few years we'll all be hosting Hunger Games final book parties. I'll be amongst the attendees I'm sure.\\n\\nAlso in terms of female main characters, Katiniss may surpass Bella in me wanting to shake sense into a character. Talk about a smart girl being utterly clueless!\\n\\nYes, it was great, but eh, maybe I'm just bitter because I think BR is the better book of the two and while Hunger Games will get tons of praise and likely a rather deserved award or two, BR will continue to be banned in many libraries. Amazing what subtracting guns can do to a story. Suddenly it doesn't feel as violent, but rather is more reminiscent of stories we heard growing up. The number of swords and arrow deaths in traditional fairytales is nothing to freak out about, but if bullets are flying, it will give \\\"too many ideas\\\" to teens and therefore must be dubbed an adult book.\\n\\nI'm pretty sure if I hadn't read BR just a few months back this exeedingly long review would have been just as long only instead of a rant it would have just been one long squeeeeeal of delight over how much I loved the book.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOriginal Comment: Peer pressure, peer pressure, peer pressure. Geez guys! Alright, alright I'll read it!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"spoilers but do y’all remember that scene in book two where all of the victors are being interviewed and keep saying shit that cuts right to the capitol’s bone, all really purposefully overdramatic, and then right after Katniss gets up and that shit with the Dress happens (which she instantly knows is a life sacrifice one of her only friends is making for her) Peeta gets up on that stage and makes a normal speech and then ends it with “I’d be fine, if it weren’t for the baby” like when is literature ever going to reach those peaks of bad bitch energy ever again\\n\\nI think this series is so fascinating in that it basically spurred an entire genre of sort-of-okay YA dystopians and then a lot of really bad YA dystopians, and it gets put a lot into that category. but...\\n\\nThe love triangle being pointless is ; Gale and Peeta are meant to represent the opposite sides of war (something a certain plot point in book three really drives home). Katniss is frankly never romantically interested in either for almost of books one and two; she grows to care about Peeta in the general sense, not just the romantic sense. The eventual romance works for Katniss because it is for her.\\n\\n(What I’m saying is this was tenderness.)\\n\\nI more think this series is interesting in how it talks about the nature of power and The uprising, as a whole, is an upswelling of the people, a realization that there is strength in numbers. Yet some of the most revolutionary actions of this series are individual — it takes Katniss’ desire to save her sister to start a war, Katniss’ love for little Rue to create horror, Cinna’s willingness to sacrifice his life to create a symbol. Even during war, the individual lives of characters like Joanna and Haymitch and Finnick . They matter to the narrative, and thus they matter to us too.\\n\\n\\n\\nKatniss Everdeen is still a deeply revolutionary heroine not only in that she’s written to be fairly gender non-conforming but also in that she is outwardly cold to all but her very few favorite people, and the narrative does not see fit to her for it, but to empathize with her and allow her to grow naturally in small ways. Her journey is not in becoming a Nice Person but in self-actualization. That is not a journey female characters are ever ever ever allowed to take and is arguably still something new.\\n\\nI almost want to case study this. It’s a similar dynamic to Lord of the Rings being blamed for the general problems of late-1900s fantasy... but worse, because criticism of the YA dystopian genre so often fell into somewhat misogynistic areas, and I don’t think there’s any point in denying that , due to having an image as Something Young Women Enjoyed™️, received far more criticism than its equivalents in other genres.\\n\\nIt's crazy that the first big ya dystopia is the best ya dystopia and one of the best series of all time, but this one is truly a classic and remains so incredible. Thank you to Katniss Everdeen for being one of the most interesting characters ever written and to this book for having such a dynamic story.\\n\\n| | | | | |\\n\\n\\n—————\\n\\n\\n1. The parallels to our own society are so amazingly drawn, and the worldbuilding so good, that I'm not surprised this book was the one that broke through.\\n2. Tell me you weren't on the edge of your seat every moment of this book. You're lying. Katniss' struggle to survive on her own is compelling and twisty. Every moment is filled with fear and tension.\\n3. Katniss Everdeen is one of the best developed, most intriguing protagonists ever written. She's badass and she's selfish and she takes no shit. In the end, I think that's what made this series so fantastic and popular.\"\n",

Yay!\\n26th to 27th march- I started reading the book\\n\\nOnce I would start reading it, I would just be sucked into it and finish the book remaining awake until early hours of morning, with my bloodshot red eyes.\\n\\nI started it and was immediately sucked into the book but then around midway I started losing interest. I fell asleep and had horrible dream (credit to graphic violence). Next morning I finished it owning to its fast pace.\\n\\nThis is . I was very much excited about it since it was my introduction to a new genre. I would like to thank this book for such amazing description of dystopian world.\\n\\n\\nThis is a kind of book which probably everyone has read including their dogs, cats and birds too!\\nSo there is no need to hide the spoilers but as warning-\\n\\nThis book started brilliantly and within few pages sucked me into it. The . Introduction to districts, new society, people’s life, the rules, the reaping, and yes ‘The hunger Games’. It is fast paced with simplistic writing. These are all good things. The best part kids are starting to read the books.\\nBut that’s where the good things end.\\nSuzanne Collins created the opportunity (golden ones) and one by one she destroyed it. But still most of the people are enthralled by the book as it eventually came out. But I’m not.\\nSo I’m going to tell very explicitly what I didn’t like...\\n\\n\\nThis story has been told through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, she just doesn't give a damn about anyone else except her family so naturally the other characters are too shallow and one dimensional.\\nMany people just love Peeta and Katniss but I don’t like either of them. was that he liked Katniss from age of five, saved her twice and is now in love with Katniss, rest is mystery.\\n, she does a lot of thing (infact she does everything in the book) but never has a second thought about them, never reflect over what she has done, eventually no attachment with the character.\\nbecause these are few characters that spent time with Katniss, but (again)no character has depth.\\nOne more outcome that I feel from other reviews is that Katniss is definitely heroine of the story but why make other 10 kids villain. While Cato and Clove make their kill they become monster but when Katniss makes her kill, it has to be justified as revenge for killing Rue and pity killing of Cato.\\nThis book is all about ...\\n\\n\\nThe plot is so much predictable that I was surprised after every 10 or 20 pages (I’m not out of my mind) because the story would turn out exactly how I would guess. First I thought that maybe my mind is highly synchronised with Collins’s mind but later on reading other reviews it turned out the plot was predictable.\\n\\n\\nThis could have been much more interesting novel. Where did it all go wrong? As I’m writing, everything wrong in story to me looks like is outcome of first person perspective.\\n--I would have felt much more connected to the games had it contained a bit of background information of every important tributes. Despite the killings being graphical, I didn’t felt sad for their deaths.\\n--, she moves over to do other things (because Rue is dying). But later when she realises that it was her first kill, still she doesn’t reflect over it even for a minute. Killing other human has effect on the killer, until and unless killer is sociopath, moreover here the killers are kids. Instead of giving insight to their mind the story flatly moves ahead with killing and ending the games.\\n\\n\\nI read books because I enjoy it and because they push my mind to a new level of thinking which benefit me. This book made me think only about, why I didn’t like this book when whole world is enjoying this. No further thoughts beyond that.\\n\\nMaciek’s thought on this book:\\n\\nFOR ALL THIS\\nIn many reviews people come out with most lame excuse (defense) I have ever heard-\\nAs for other books in the series, I will definitely read them but I’m not in hurry or excited with this prospect. I will read it someday, probably before second installment of the movie.\\n\\n\\n- I watched the movie\\nturned out pretty good, much better than I had anticipated. As I watched the movie it seemed that novel was written with movie in mind. Few minor changes, like in the end President Snow shown thinking representing its start of story unlike novel which ends. Some scenes are breath taking, too much violence. Acting by Jennifer Lawrence is good (she turned out better than Katniss in the book). I liked the movie, rated it 7/10.\\n\\nThis review is inspired by and .\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I sat down to this book prepared to be captivated in its pages. But I was disappointed. I was always expecting that finally the author would show her genius and knock me off my feet. But it never happened. Yes, it was exciting and entertaining. But it wasn't a truly great book.\\n\\nI could not stop comparing this to Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. Like Fahrenheit 451, it was a dystopian novel set in the future, but Fahrenheit 451 had significant symbolism on every page, paragraph, and even half the sentences. I was so scared because it was so life-like and realistic. I could see how undeniably prophetic Bradbury was and how we are slowly, ever so slowly, slipping closer and closer to that world. I saw the similarities of the worlds; I felt inspired to stop us from falling into that trap too.\\n\\nBut The Hunger Games never provoked me to think or inspired me to act. It was like a roller-coaster. You get on and momentarily take an exciting spin. But that's all. You're just taken there. You're not drawn in. You don't have to do anything. You just sit there and your stomach flops over and over as opposed to your mind working, thinking, puzzling, imagining. The writing style wasn't even good, and the grammar was actually quite poor. What really annoyed me about the writing style was that I knew paragraphs before if something exciting was going to happen. Just the way that Suzanne Collins wrote blew away the whole surprise and shock of an attack.\\n\\nI ended up asking, \\\"So what?\\\" She could have awoken the reader to real problems by showing us what could happen if we don't take action. But she never really got to the point. She focused instead on entertaining us, on giving us a sob story. There was so much potential in this book. What I'm trying to say is that there was so much that Suzanne Collins could have done to make this book a masterpiece like Fahrenheit 451. But she just didn't.\\n\\nI do want to read the next book though. I'll take another ride on the roller-coaster.\"\n",

So maybe Matthew Fox from Lost isn't exactly the person you had in mind when you thought about who they might cast as Katniss in The Hunger Games, but I was inspired to create that after I saw You might want to wait to visit it, though, because it can suck you in like an unexplained time warp flash.\\n\\nI was also inspired to create the Jackniss after I read a discussion that deeply disturbed me.\\n\\nSomewhere, possibly on Goodreads, I read that someone thought the . What!?!? Forget the genius Suzanne Collins, let's give it to the guys who left the greatest mystery in all of TV history completely unexplained. Don't get me wrong. I love Lost and appreciate it greatly, but they really explained nothing in terms of the plot. But don't even get me started on that - Circuits overloading. Bzzzt. *sparks*\\n\\nBoth Lost and Hunger Games are great character stories, but Hunger Games plot. It cannot do without. That's obviously not going to happen since Suzanne has already written the script, but just play along for a second.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow,, I won't even try to justify why you should. You just should. This is just one of those books that someone says \\\"This book is AMAZING.\\\" Then, you take their word for it and read it.\\n\\nAnd seriously, WHY haven't you read it yet?\\n\\nThis is the kind of book that is so awesome in a completely thrilling and demented and emotional and shocking way that it makes you want to bang your head against the wall while throwing fairy dust in joy. Two things that I have done in the past, but before at the same time. That's how powerful this book is.\\n\\nAfter that, it makes you want to cry. Cry like a little baby. Like a little baby in it's crib. Then scream. Scream like a frikkin banshee with a frikkin laser beam on it's forehead.\\n\\nBefore I read this, I had a friend who told me that this book was 100 times better than Twilight. (I'd say that it's actually more like a gorgonzolazillion times better and don't ask me the exact amount that represents. Let's just call it \\\"To infinity and beyond.\\\") She also said that it was going to be an even bigger phenomenon than Twilight. I was like \\\"Hah!\\\" Let's face it, it can get ridiculous with the Fangirl mobbing and the crying. But I concur. I think this WILL be bigger than Twilight and obviously better. Maybe even Oscar worthy. I certainly hope so, anyway.\\n\\nI know that I said I wouldn't try and talk you into reading this book but I honestly can't help it. I'm not sure that I'm doing a great job at it, though. Let's try a little visual aid.\\n\\nHere is an artist's rendering of our heroine, Katniss Everdeen:\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd here's the gorgeous young lady who has been cast. Jennifer Lawrence.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe may not seem like the spitting image of the girl from the book, but there is such a thing as hair dye and dirt. And and there is Photoshop, of course. So here is a pic that someone made and posted online of Jennifer as Katniss. It may change your mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd this side by side.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll right, besides the oversized cartoon eye, she is pretty damn close. Well, I'm convinced. How bout you?\\n\\n\\nAs if that wasn't enough, :\\n\\n\\nAlso, here's the artists version of Peeta, our hero.\\n\\n\\n\\nI know that a lot of people would disagree but, to me, guy is Peeta.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd just so everyone knows - The Hunger Games is currently .\\n\\nDownload it .\\n\\nI'm not sure how long the sale will last, though.

      "      \"review\": \"May the odds be ever in your favour\\n\\nPanem is a nation that lies in what used to be known as North America with a Capitol which is surrounded by 12 districts. To discourage rebellion the Capitol forces each district to send a tribute of one boy and one girl a year to participate in The Hunger Games. A deadly competition which is aired live on TV, and in the end there is only one victor, only one survivor.\\n\\n\\n\\nKatniss Everdeen, a sixteen year old girl from district 12, volunteers to take the place of her little sister in the games. Luckily Katniss is used to surviving under the harshest circumstances. But what Katniss doesn't realise is that being able to kill and hunt is not the only things that will help her stay alive but also forming friendships, alliances, and making sure the audience likes her.\\n\\n\\nPicking up this book again had me transported to my younger THG obsessed self. I find myself thinking about the hunger games quite often. And how nothing I've read since 2012 has ever had such an impact on me.\\n\\nI will always admire Katniss's love for her sister. Her strength and unwillingness to give up. She's spent so long in survival mode that it's hard for her to have normal relationships with people and she constantly questions everyone's motives. I must say though that's probably what kept her alive in the arena.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRereading this was a whole other experience. It's been almost 10 years since I first read these books, I noticed things I didn't before. Things that annoyed me then, are clearer to me now and I think I connected to the characters even more than I did back in my first read.\\n\\nThe writing is not very descriptive. It has little embellishments but I think it does a good job of reflecting Katniss's personality, who is a very straight forward and ‘no-nonsense’ type of person.\\n\\nAnd while I'm not really a fan of books being told in the first person, I don't mind reading Katniss's POV. The writing is still very immersive and I think Collins did a good job of making the reader feel part of the story.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fast pacing and action keeps you hooked. I can't even explain the on edge feeling you get while reading this. Even for me who has already read this book and watched the movie countless times.\\n\\nOver the years I've fallen out of love with dystopian books and in general I don't really like books set in the future. I know, I know what is wrong with me right?!\\nMaybe it's because, , nothing really compares to THG.\\n\\nThe setting is so unique. I love how the bareness of district 12 is described compared to the ostentation of the Capitol.\\n\\nThe world of the hunger games is definitely not one I'd ever want to visit ; )\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI'll admit I became very emotional (are we even surprised by now) while rereading this. I think it's because I already know what's in-store for the characters.\\n\\nI found it immensely funny how suspicious she was of Peeta and his genuine kindness.\\n\\n\\n\\nAh, Peeta Mellark. Our sweet cinnamon roll. He's just so: ❤🐣🌻🌞✨\\nLiterally can't believe there are people out there shipping Katniss with Gale when we have our precious baker right here.\\n\\nThe part where be said : — had me crying like a baby. My love for Peeta Mellark knows no bounds.\\n\\nMaybe I didn't notice before because I was more concerned for Katniss but this time my heart really felt for Haymitch. Even when you win the games there's still no escaping them. And besides his own horrors he had to face in the games and other things the Capitol did to him, every year he had to watch as two more kids got killed, for which he most likely feels responsible. I never really gave much thought before to how he coped with all that.\\n\\nI love the movies and for a long time I believed that they were so great that it might not even be necessary to read the books as long as you've seen the movies (which are master pieces. in my opinion the best adaptations of all time) but during this reread I realised that there is an element to the books that could not be translated to screen. The movies are good companions to the books but could never replace them.\\n\\nIf you have not read I highly suggest you try them out. It's never too late! They are great to read no matter your age, but I think they're also really great for young teens who are starting to get into reading or even those who are reluctant readers. Personally these books opened up other world's to me and will always hold a prestigious spot on my shelves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n___\\nRereading this for the first time since i read it way back when!! i already feel like I'm back in 2012 when everyone was so hyped about the movie.\\n\\n___\\n\\nI was planning to reread these books this year but with coming out in 2020 I'll rather wait closer to that release date.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"~SO THIS IS WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT~\\nTHE HUNGER GAMES is a fantastic, breathless and somewhat brutal read that once you start you simply can’t put down again. Initially I had no idea what this book was about or what to expect in terms of YA writing, it had just been recommended to me by so many people and had such a buzz surrounding it that I had to find out for myself why. Well let me say I was not disappointed and have now joined the legions of Suzanne Collins fans in awaiting her next instalment.\\n\\nWritten along the lines of Stephen King’s or Orwell’s (I may be aging myself here) this story still feels very original and sucked me in completely with its modern day Survivor-esque retelling. The Hunger Games is the ultimate in reality TV, suspense, scripted realism, romance and survival that you should not miss.\\n\\nSet in a post apocalyptic future (although we frustratingly never learn the why's, how’s or even when of this future.) This new communist-type America known as Panem has been divided into a Capital and its 12 districts. We follow 16 year old Katniss as she struggles to keep her starving family alive, hunting and gathering with her best friend Gale. Unbeknownst to her these are valuable skills as the annual hunger games are about to begin.\\n\\nEach year these games require two children from each district who are chosen based on a lottery system for compulsory participation. These televised games are then broadcast throughout Panem (with mandatory viewing) as the 24 contestants fight each other to the death, leaving just one victor at its violent conclusion. It’s kind of like Survivor but instead of being voted off the island you have to kill your competitors. When Katniss’s younger sister is chosen as the female contestant from their district Katniss volunteers to take her place. Then together with Peeta the other lottery winner they travel to the capital and begin preparations for the opening ceremonies and ultimately their death in The Hunger Games.\\n\\nOddly this has been written without paragraph breaks and I have to admit the first part of it dragged for me, as Katniss is groomed, clothed, and schooled by her entourage within the capital. However as soon as the games begin, lookout! By this point in the story you have become attached to several key characters and its then that you realize things can’t end well as there will be only one winner. Over a period of about 2 weeks and against overwhelming odds we watch 24 victims dwindle as they struggle to survive. Simultaneously avoiding and hunting each other they form alliances, face hunger and mind numbing thirst, mutant animal attacks, friendship, love and ultimately a distrust of everyone as Big Brother raises the stakes to keep the audience interested.\\n\\nThis is an exciting book that will keep you up late into the night and resonate with you long after you’ve finished.

      "      \"review\": \"The Hunger Games is relevant. Today, more so than ever, it is relevant. The recent happenings of the world have left me questioning between what is real and what is fiction. The lines have blurred. They always have been but - today, more so than ever, it is evident.\\n\\nLittle me didn't understand the true depth of this series. For her, being a person who may not have been a citizen of the Capitol but still someone who could eat three meals a day, go to school, have a happy childhood with no worries; the biggest worry for that girl used to be was who Katniss was going to end up with. . The million dollar question.\\n\\nBut now that i'm older, now that i am slowly feeling the burden of responsibilities, now that i can see how the people of this world are, now that i've been exposed to our world - I can how relevant this book is.\\n\\nEverytime i discuss this book with someone the first question always seems to be: Gale or Peeta? I understand these questions to some extent. They are easier to ask. Easier to start a conversation with. But i can't help but think that this was the entire message of Hunger Games. How literal killing of children was going on in the games but the people of Capitol were dumbing it down to the romance of two people. I'm not criticizing people who like Everlark, hell, i'm one of their biggest fans.\\n\\nBut as compelling the romantic aspect is, it's so so crucial to remember that .\\n\\nIt boggles my mind when i'm scrolling on social media and one video is of a hospital being bombed (🍉) or a mother crying over her dead baby and the next is some Hollywood celebrity looking like a peacock on the Met Gala Carpet. It sickens me to no extent. The fact that i can look at this extravagance and tell myself that the people of Capitol would end up wearing it should be enough of a proof. YES it is their money and they can do whatever the hell with it, they can have fun but this kind of decadence is crazy to me.\\n\\nSeeing things like this reminds me of that conversation that occurs between Plutarch Heavensbee and Snow in Catching Fire:\\n\\n\\n\\nand this critique on how society can become desensitized to real suffering while focusing on the trivial, sensational and the frivolous aspects of life - isn't that what's going on in our world?\\n\\nThere are so so many better reviews and video essays that have explained this in a much better and more detailed way that i have or i can. But i appreciate Suzanne Collins so so much for this book.\\n\\nI remember that quote from George Orwell that goes like:\\n\\nand isn't that the ultimate truth?\\n\\nReading this book always ends up shaking me to my core. An absolutely amazing series. I will never stop recommending it.\"\n",

Well, that's not entirely true, either... is told from the PoV of a teen girl in a magical struggle for her life, and yet it got four full and eager stars.\\n\\nSo why didn't I like this book?\\n\\nBecause the whole thing is a cynical exercise in marketing a product that has elements the publisher recognized as hot and trending: Strong teen girl; dystopian setting; children in battle for their lives.

No humor, ungraceful writing, and cold business calculation set it apart from the Potter books.\\n\\nI don't know Ms. Collins, and I impute no impure motives to her.

That it's so unquestioningly lauded is either life-sappingly grim or suicide-inducingly terrible. In a country where free speech is ever under attack (hence the First Amendment, and laws supporting it...no one legislates the safety of a thing unquestioned), we waste our collective breath lauding a second-rate industrial product, a foolish simplistic ramshackle pastiche of better books that, in a better world, would merit only silence and oblivion.\\n\\nShame.

This book came out when YA dystopia was all the rage, and while I’d say most of the others have not aged well The Hunger Games remains relevant even now.\\n\\n- The politics. A world where 12 districts are kept in slave like conditions after a revolt against their cruel captors fails. Forced into sending their children to fight in a battle to the death as a constant reminder to know their place. Not to rock the boat. Relevant.\\n\\n- I even like the romance/fake romance. Whatever you believe is going on. I love Katniss’ indecision - it’s so realistic. I love Gale and Peeta. Though ultimately I am team Peeta.\\n\\n- The characters. Katniss is a great main character. She isn’t the typical YA heroine, not many people like her, she is brash, honest and uptight and I love her.\\nAlso all the side characters are so well formed, full of flaws but ultimately fantastic. One of my absolute favourites being Haymitch.\\n\\n- You are constantly on the edge of your seat. Never boring, always terrified what will happen next. Just so unputdownable.\\n\\nFinally, not book related specifically but I love how well the films represent the book. There is one major thing they didn’t include which is a shame\\nBut there are so many scenes that made it to the films and I loved it.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Well this book lived up to a lot of the hype that surrounds it. While the name and cover still do not grab my attention the story, once started, did.\\n\\nThis book is written in first perspective, from the heroine's aspect. Her name is Katniss Everdeen. She starts off in her home, a simple, poor area of the land. She is the provider for her mother and sister with her hunting skills. To protect her younger sister, she is sent to the capitol, along with local boy Peeta, to 'participate' in the annual Hunger Games.\\n\\nThese 'games' are fights to the death, aired and shown to the capitol and all 12 districts under its control, in a survival arena of sorts. The book shows, throughout the story, a somewhat futuristic dystopia society. The tributes (Katniss, Peeta and others in the game) are given basic weapons (bows, spears, clubs) and the district where Katniss is from uses herbs and eats basic foods (squirrel, wild turkey, etc) but the capitol has voice command room service, automatic hair dryers, and a camera/screen set that tracks and shows the tributes (no matter where they go) to the viewers. It is an interesting combination.\\n\\nThere is a 'romantic' setting as well. Katniss and Peeta are to appear as a united team to the people. Peeta even admits to liking her during his interview. So a setting for 'star-crossed lovers' is created. However, Katniss has various feelings toward Peeta throughout the book and its very realistic and understandable, especially when there is possibly another guy back home.\\n\\nYet while there are time I can relate to her, at the same time several of her thoughts want to make my roll my eyes or drop my head onto a desk. While she is survival smart, she is not people smart. She can't socialize and cannot read people worth a darn. While it is annoying at times, it is also endearing and has created a unique character.\\n\\nOverall, very good book. 4 1/2 stars is my official opinion, but I will give it 5 since I can't do halves. Its a constant pace of survival, and action with just the right touch of romantic possibilities. I look forward to the next book.\\n\\n2023- Audiobook. This time I really wondered why Haymitch made the choices he made. What was happening in the Capitol and how hard did he try to get them help. What help did others get? I liked seeing how level-headed Katniss is yet still had flaws and made a few poor choices (or at least potentially poor). I was hooked about her relation to Rue and how she even confused her with her sister a bit. That would not be the place for that type of thought!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I’ve had this book recommended to me several times over the years. I don’t know why. Not only is this book completely terrible, but it is also not the sort of thing I would normally read. I did, however, approach this book with an open mind. I expected to like it, but not love it. What I didn’t expect was to hate it so passionately. There are just too many things wrong with it. In all honesty I do not understand the success this book has achieved. For me, it is complete rubbish.\\n\\n\\n\\nI find it impossible to accept this world. It wasn’t because it was a nasty place, but because it wasn’t believable. The Capitol puts on these Hunger Games and sacrifices countless children in the process. I mean….what? Children. Why would the Capitol do this? If I was in charge of the Capitol I would have developed a much more effective system. I’d have fixed the games so the leaders of each district were sacrificed each year. That way there would be no one left to lead an uprising against the Capitol. And those left in the districts wouldn’t have the courage or reason to lead an uprising. They’d want to keep their heads down because they would be sacrificed next if they too led a rebellion. Problem solved. Capitol rules the districts in oppressive peace.\\n\\nThat’s beside the point, though, because the cruelty of sacrificing is also too far-fetched. The residents of the Capitol are vain and greedy, but vain and greedy is a long way off from sadistic and brutal. I found it difficult to accept that in the Capitol there wasn’t streets filled with violent protestors trying to save the lives of these kids. It just didn’t work for me. The children are far too accepting and almost stoic when they are selected. I would go kicking and screaming. Their families just watch them go and accept; then they rebel later, idiots. The children also don’t seem to be that afraid. They may have become used to the process, but surely the horror of this situation would lead to panic attacks and break downs?\\n\\nThen there are the games themselves. The whole thing is recorded by invisible cameras. There is a whole world of wrong with that. It seems to me like Collins wrote herself into a box and the only solution she could come up with was “I know I’ll make the cameras invisible!” Then there is the idea of Peeta’s camouflage skills. Basically, Collins suggests that because Peeta was a baker and decorated his cakes artfully, despite the district being in poverty, he can then camouflage his entire body into the surroundings of the arena using his said cake decorating skills. Now, that was plain stupid. I don’t think she thought these ideas through enough.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuzanne Collins writes in an incredibly simple manner. There is no eloquence in her expression and prose; it is all very lifeless and flat, just like her world and characters. This may be for a younger audience, but that doesn’t excuse the blandness of her writing: it’s weak and unimaginative. I’m not sure if she purposely wrote in this way or if that’s just how she writes in general, but either way the result is a book that appears as if it’s been written by a ten year old. The sentence structure is basic, and very rarely changes. This can work if the language feels powerful, but if doesn’t. The whole novel feels elementary.\\n\\nThe characters are just as bad. The obvious romance that has, and is, being created is just tiresome. I don’t think this should have included the romance complication. I think Collins should have focused more upon writing a realistic story before she delved into the complexities of teenage relationships. This, again, was simple and straightforward. I literally have nothing positive to say about this book. For me, it doesn’t have a single redeeming feature or quality: it is just utter drivel.\\n\\nEverything about this book is basic and weak. No doubt, I shall receive a string of comments from people defending this book, but this is just my opinion of it. I’m not wrong and neither are you. This is simply my opinion of a terribly overrated, poorly considered and badly written book. Deal with it. I welcome discussion, but not those who are going to simply say that I’m wrong with no reasoning behind their argument. Also, this is another of those rare cases when the movie is actually better than the book. This says a lot because the movie is awful.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I absolutely hate this book and don’t recommend it to anyone.\\n\\n\\n1. The Hunger Games-\\n2. Catching Fire-\\n3.

I can't tell what exactly it is that works so well - the absolutely perfect pacing, the heart, Katniss' unforgettable voice or her love for Prim and Rue, or Peeta's kindness. Whatever it is, this book keeps me in thrall every time and makes me forget about the ultimately shoddy dystopian premise.\\n\\n_______\\n\\n\\nThis book was recommended to me after I read Unwind by Neal Shusterman and although maybe it is not as emotionally affecting as Unwind, I still think it is a fantastic book. The story has just the perfect combination of action, drama, and romance. It has a great message that you can stay human even in the most inhumane conditions. Needless to say, I am anxiously awaiting the sequel. I am sure even greater things are to come in the next book.\\n\\nJust finished rereading this book and it is as great as I remember it to be. What especially stands out is how tightly plotted and edited it is. Every chapter is a perfection with no wasted words or paragraphs, no filler. Every chapter has an incredible impact and always ends with an emotional \\\"bang.\\\" I think I am now prepared for \\\"Catching Fire\\\" and hope my expectations are not too high...\\n\\nWhat else is there to say about this fantastic book? What is the better testament to this novel's greatness than the fact that it is just as affecting after the 3rd reading as it was after the 1st, if not more. My heart is aching for Katniss, Peeta, and whole Panem. Please, Suzanne, don't disappoint us with . And can Peeta stay alive too? I don't care if he gets the girl, but I love him and want him to make it through.\\n\\nPost-movie. Still adore the book. I love and hate the feeling it gives me.

      "      \"review\": \"**On a second reading after over a decade, I am forced to recognize that The Hunger Games is terrific, well-paced entertainment (at least for the first two-thirds; the cave-dwelling drags on long enough to disrupt the momentous action in service of the relationship angle that vexed me on my initial reading).\\n\\nThe prose is superior to and more engaging than in most sub-standard fare of similar categories, with an appreciable amount more gruesomeness and visceral detail than I recalled. The only habit of Collins that grated on me this time around was her frequent implementation of tautological descriptions of food and garments:\\n-dress = a soft blue thing\\n-sheets = soft, silky fabric\\n-hot chocolate = hot, sweet, creamy liquid\\n-wine = tart, dry liquid\\nI can accept it as Katniss not being familiar with these products of luxury, describing her first experience with them in clunky, basic terms, but I’d have accepted paragraph long revelatory soliloquies over mundanely stating the obvious that most beverages are indeed liquids.\\n\\nI’ll let my original review stand, with caveats, but I’m bumping it up a half star for being no less enjoyable the second time around and maintaining my interest enough to finally give the sequels a go.**\\n\\n\\nDespite its exposure and fame, I managed not to acquire any knowledge of this phenomenon prior to cracking the spine for the first time. The cover might as well have a Mr. Yuck sticker on it with that pendant and stupid crop-circle design that gives the impression of a story about child secret agents or something. This was sufficient enough for quite some time to repel me. But now, let’s see what we’ve actually got here:\\n\\nKid’s book about a continent-ally broadcasted snuff film.\\n\\n\\n\\nI refuse (as best I can) to hold young adult fiction to a different standard than all other fiction. A younger target demographic should not garner leniency or its corollary prejudice, perfunctory dismissal. I am not exemplary in keeping with this sentiment as my own predilections after experiences with household titles of the ‘genre’ like and the endless crop of crap since soured me to anything to be found in the YA section. I have been harboring a mentality of ‘kids-today’ intransigence. So, I have a low standard for popular teen series (I’m not suggesting this is anything more than incidental, but this realm tends to be dominated by female authors) and have come to expect scant substance in plot or character development.\\n\\nHowever, having indicted myself on that front and prefacing with that rather obvious point, I am pleased to say that I do not think Suzanne Collins treats her readers—young ones in particular—like idiots. Many of her readers were mere toddlers, infants, or yet to be conceived on that infamous day in September of 2001, and have grown up in a world that is very distinguishable from the world we knew before. They are coming of age in a world of increasing uncertainty, of static fear, and a minimal amount of hope.\\n\\nI was going to attempt to avoid any mention of the film, but allow me to offer one quote from the supercilious ‘President’ of Panem, Coriolanus Snow: Spoken like a true (and intelligent) dictator. Saddam could have learned something if only he’d clutched to power (and life) in time to hear it. This book speaks to the potential grimness of the future, as well as paralleling tribulations and distractions of the past.\\n\\nAs for ‘The Games’, just what would it take for a society to descend into such madness, again (see next section)? Don’t get ahead of me. I won’t get too far into this, but there are risks society is comfortable with for the sake of entertainment right now, ladies and gentlemen. Has anyone ever died for our entertainment? When something ‘goes wrong’ in competitive sports, we talk about how sad and shocking it is, until we blithely sit down for the next game/match. I’m not making a social statement so much as suggesting that considering ourselves more civilized because we don’t kill people for entertainment purposes any longer may be slightly naive. (Not to mention that political division seems to point to us gladly throwing one another to the lions).\\n\\nHowever thin and sophomoric this analogy may be, we want violence with consequences for people in our entertainment, whether as participant or spectator. (I've had broken noses and knuckles to attest to this). It’s been inherent to our species since, well, boredom (a pesky consequence of consciousness). I apologize, but this had to make it into a review .\\n\\n\\nDystopian and post-apocalyptic scenarios in literature are nothing terribly groundbreaking any longer, but I haven’t heard too many critics making the claim that this book ‘rips off’ or . What else is there to focus on? Ah, yes, a pitting-against-each-other of young people with no personal qualms or vendettas against one another for the entertainment and disillusionment of the general populace who are collected, or “reaped” in a public display of revolutionary peacekeeping dominance and subjugation. What does that remind us of? Oh, right! Say it with me everyone! (I won’t get into this again). Indeed there blatant literary hack jobs, for which the words ‘inspired by’ may absolutely not be applied. There are also retellings ( and are masterful and imaginative in their own respective rights without even needing to evoke anything Homeric). We recognize the source, judge with equanimity, and conclude based on what they bring the story, or what source elements they use to or their story. We do (I speak optimistically) fling accusatory excrement of imitation or fraudulence simply because comparisons can be drawn between something and something else. I cannot speak as to whether or not Collins drew any direct inspiration from Koushun Takami (or Ancient Rome), but this book appears to be neither a hack job nor a riding-on-the-coattails of anything that preceded it.\\n\\nthe retroactively, refreshingly imperfect heroine thinks to herself, arousing unexpected respect from yours truly. In this particular instance, she makes the best of the environment in which she finds herself as darkness seems to be closing in on her. If there is ever that chance that it will be the end, it is easy to focus on what could be the last scent, or sensation one experiences. The fatigue, the accumulated stress and piled-on pain, the anguish and concealed desperation (not to mention the sleep deprivation the night before ‘The Games’ begin). It is all conveyed by Katniss with such vulnerable clarity that simple human empathy is only the first stage in coming to relate to her.\\n\\nHer second-guessing w/r/t everything Peeta says, or does (including saving her life) is significant beyond the context of wanting to survive. Her anxiety over these matters is no idle inner monologue, but validates for us our precarious dispositions when considering ulterior motives when someone pays us a kindness. These neuroses are not always justified, but they are unavoidable as dictated by our nature; one of those refreshing imperfections I was referring to above.\\n\\n\\n\\nI will gloss over the less-than-necessary love triangle aspect as it seems to be the prominent point of ridicule for the more ‘serious’ readers (albeit I could think of reasons to defend it). The first person narrative grants us access to Katniss’ every thought, but the ending of this first installment is one of romantic ambiguity nonetheless. We have a better idea of Peeta’s true feelings by this point, but I am among the cohort who cares little for this—what I would deem—subplot.\\n\\nGeneric, overpowered Katniss is not (at least not in this first book, and not enough to suspend all suspension of disbelief). Katniss is not out for blood. She is not an annoying man-hater trying to smash the patriarchy by bitching at the young men entrapped under precisely the same circumstances in which she finds herself; she is a reticent, unintentional badass, which is the only kind worthy of the title, as far as I am concerned. (This novel has the benefit of being written before that trope was all but required in mainstream entertainment, and for that, I am relieved).\\n\\nI made a joke to myself as I neared the end of the novel. “When do the vampires come in?” I cynically asked. Little did I know that werewolf-like creatures were soon to make their debut. I didn’t hate the implementation (and it was better than what the film did), and upon realizing that they were, in fact, the reanimated, mutated corpses of her former adversaries (and sweet, furry little Rue), Katniss was provided with further existential speculation. Did these creatures want revenge, did they possess the memories along with the molecules of their (former?) selves, or are they autonomous killing machines? Also, what the hell happened to them after they scampered off? Perhaps I’ll find out. But!... but, beyond that it came off as more teen-pandering fantasy fare that detracted from the verisimilitude I had hitherto gotten used to. I realize the novel is often classified as sci-fi, but this stretched the limits of what I expected. ; I suppose the pun works, though.\\n\\nThen, when ‘The Games’ are finished and Claudius Templesmith revokes his previous announcement that two winners will be allowed (dun, dun, dun!) and Katniss has the brilliant idea of a faux-suicide-pact, prompting Claudius to revoke his revocation in a graceless sort of kind of way, it just didn’t work. I understand it was meant to transmit humiliation for ‘The Capitol’, but it really came off as Collins pulling off a last-ditch effort at a final twist (of the most expected and trite variety). Unless it was meant to be religious satire (Abraham, Isaac, a goat, God, you know) it was not a particularly meaningful note on which to conclude the violence. No gasps were induced. A shrug was too much to muster.\\n\\nI’ll cut myself off there with those couple examples. The book has flaws, but they were not so numerous or egregious that it ruined the overall experience. The writing quality has its flaws just like the plot, but it’s pretty damn good for the most part. It is mostly straightforward storytelling, but doesn’t slouch on elegant, effective prose that youngsters can understand:\\n\\n\\n\\nI can’t help but think that the political allegory, which can be interpreted into any narrative, is rather overstated, if not mostly unfounded (to say nothing of the liberal-conservative ‘debate’ since the film’s release of whose ideals it best represents, but you don't get a seizing of the means of production like that outside Communism, just saying). The things I discussed in my opening statements are not inherent in this story, rather what I gathered when I read into it. They logically follow, I believe, from what the story itself forthrightly presents us with, but to read this as some kind of for our future, save for the conceivable degeneration of risk-taking entertainment into near-deliberate killing, is sailing out to sea a little bit. I may be starting to contradict myself, so I will take my leave.\\n\\nOops…\"\n",

That aside, it’s easily one of the most formative, important, and beloved books of my life thus far, and I’ve read it so many times that it feels like a crime not to put a little something down in words.\\n\\n\\nfelt like the dawning of an era; it was my introduction to dystopian sci-fi and was the first book, in my teens, that made me legitimately reconsider the things I’d always been taught about the US government, politics, and society at large. I’d grown up in a solidly sheltered, religious, and politically conservative home, and had never questioned much of what I’d been told up to that point. I’ll never forget reading this book for the first time, and that moment of wondering if this could all become a reality, and weighing my own mortality a little more heavily than I had before.\\n\\n\\nDoom and gloom aside, this is one of my favorite books of all time and it has not lost an ounce of its spark for me. To this day, I think Katniss is one of the most courageous, sensible, and inspiring protagonists I’ve ever seen. I’m still more than a little in love with Cinna, I’ll never fix the crack in my heart from sweet Rue, and I’ll always root for the boy with the bread. As an adult and a mother, everything in me hurts so much more for these poor, broken tributes — even the vicious, bloodthirsty ones who don’t know anything else — and I’m endlessly amazed by the world that Suzanne Collins created in Panem.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBuddy read with and !\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Before I pile praise upon praise on The Hunger Games’ capital concept, plotting, brutality, symbolism, characters, dynamics,‌ suspense, intrigue, and themes, I need to get the negative out of the way and address why #TheMovieDidItBetter:\\n\\nAt the time of the writing of this book, Suzanne Collins was not, , a storyteller.\\n\\nShe was a story-maker, yes, but not teller. And consequently, she established THG as a rare exception to rule. I’m sure you’ve heard this rule going from mouth to mouth, screen to screen, drive to drive; perhaps you’re even one of the people who deny the validity of such a claim—if yes, then let’s talk it out. To understand how a rule can be broken, we need to learn what it in the first place. So, anyone up for more-than-a-little analysis?\\n\\n()\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWords are tricky things; they can touch, paint, smell, shine, sound, sing, bleed, feel, tear, hurt, stab, steal, swallow, spill. That is the power of language.\\n\\nA book’s writing and prose is not equivalent to the writing of a film’s screenplay (), but the directing of the film. The same way authors capture the essence and ambience of a book through descriptions and turns of phrase—wielding words as a swordsman would a blade or an archer a bow and arrow—directors build the atmosphere and weave the tale using methods such as determining the lighting, colouring, angle of the camera, etc etc.\\n\\nBut whatever one might do, directors are at a disadvantage, because there is one thing they cannot do; How, you wonder?\\n\\nTake the sense of smell, as an example. Authors convey it with the way it’s described (), directors with the way it’s shown (). But can they both ensnare thoughts and concealed feelings? The answer is simple: directors cannot achieve it without using words (), except if they said thoughts and feelings through occasional trips into the person’s head and depicting them through visualisation; which would be incredible, but one must admit it would be confusing and most would not care for it.\\n\\nThus, Say, if it’s a character they would not possibly relate to, or one who has barely any redeeming actions and they could not otherwise feel for, writers have the weapon and power to still make their audience understand the character—without having them explain it to someone else, as directors have to, with their hands tied as it is.\\n\\nThe question is, why do I believe adaptation for the big screen was better than the original book?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllow me to ask for the help of a metaphor in driving my exhausted point home and letting it rest ():\\n\\n\\n\\nTell me, what score would this chef get in a cooking contest?\\n\\nSuzanne Collins’ writing of the first installment in her YA dystopian trilogy is absolutely weak and lacking, failing to do justice to the perfection that are all other aspects of the book, and then some. Not only is it the epitome and definition of the ultimate “” problem, barely giving reports of most events and falling short in the “” department, it is even unsatisfactory in the telling. Frankly, it’s closer to a screenplay than than a novel. No wonder the movie is better, filling in all the blanks left by Collins’ pen.\\n\\nAlas, I think that’s enough complaining for one day; it’s time to swoon!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\na dark and bloody reality TV show following the lives of children and teens of the oppressed districts and throwing them into an arena to kill eachother until one remains standing, all used as a means to controlling the masses? are not strong enough words for the utter brilliance of this idea. And it’s not just the penning of the idea—but also its execution—that has turned this book into a thing of exceptional value.\\n\\n\\naside from the main theme () there is the ever present proof that Katniss accomplishes none of what she does, alone, helped and spurred by Cinna, Peeta, and Haymitch, making it pleasantly realistic; there is the overtaking of a human’s survival instincts; the trauma induced by living on a constant fight-or-flight setting; the politics of oppression and control and capitalism; and music, oh music which I appreciate indefinitely. All inspired and unforgettable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nhowever much I might whine about how Suzanne Collins told the tale, you will find me equally praising how she the tale—the elements, the events, the scenes, their mix and time of delivery, their direction and tightly wrapped manner, the hilarious moments of reprieve and clues and tidbits for cohesively setting the plot of the sequels. I could go on but I shouldn’t ramble, suffice it to say that her plotting is optimum.\\n\\nfirst and foremost, Katniss. She might not be one of my all-time favourite MCs, but she’s close and I love her, because of being a practical, angry fighter who is unapologetically harsh and hostile (); thankfully not the gushing type, she’s also not witty or alluring or cocky or ferocious, which might be more of my fave traits, but her not possessing them is something I like, too—\\n\\nOne assessment I disagree with is her being selfish or cowardly. Trust me, being rather self-absorbed myself, I can tell Katniss is not cut from the same cloth. It’s simply that, for years, her life has been about survival; her focus, the basest needs of humans to continue on living, the needs of herself and her family and friends. Survival has become the language she speaks and operates on. And it’s because of this that her actions could be interpreted as selfish and cowardly where she is quite selfless and brave, and because of this that, at first, she does not comprehend the rebellious thoughts of Gale or Peeta, their desire to say enough. She learns, though. She learns.\\n\\n\\nAnd Peeta! My boy of words and self-deprecating humour, throwing a leash around his audience every time he opens his mouth. People skills is another one of my aforementioned fave traits, and I’ll throw a quick shout-out to the arrogant, insufferable, and destructive Haymitch () and tiresome, clueless yet determined Effie who needs to be protected :')\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto me, one of the gems of this YA debut is the complicated dynamics. I admit, And Katniss with her thoughts of killing vs. protecting Peeta draws me in like a moth to the flame. She’s destructive and he absorbs it, asking for more.\\n\\nThough, I should note that there are two sides to this dynamic: the reality and the act. My words above discuss the real side, as the act had me literally and involuntarily gagging by the end—seeing an angry and vengeful MC I rooted for and somehow related to forcing herself to be reduced to a blushing sweet little girl made me want to repeatedly vomit on my book. Thank goodness for the last few pages.\\n\\nsymbols symbols, how I adore them! We have Panem, the name of the nation, clearly driven from the metonymic phrase which translates into “bread and circuses” and is referring to superficial appeasement; here, namely, that of the Capitol. Symbols are, in general, an area Collins generally excels at ().\\n\\npolitics, methods of oppression, strategies for controlling the masses; mind games, angles to play with, tricks to gaining support and attentions. It’s . Games and intrigue are always the best thing to have in a book.\\n\\nwhile Collins’ writing is not particularly suspenseful in this book—or any of her works, really—the plotting is so commendably and excellently wound that each page is dripping in suspense, creating a constant assault of possibility which is only boosted by my next point of highlight...\\n\\nanyone who knows me, or is aware of how my favourite authors are and knows that I treasure books who don’t pull punches. And a YA with this quality is a rarity I can’t help but be smitten with. In fact, So, beware of the warnings.\\n\\n\\ngraphic violence, murder, blood and gore, alcoholism, loss, PTSD, depression, abandonment, hunting animals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n• The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1) ★★★★☆\\n• (The Hunger Games, #2) ★★★★★\\n• (The Hunger Games, #3) ★★★★½\\n• (The Hunger Games, #0) ★★★★★\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"i just woke up from a disturbing little nightmare that strangely involved The Hunger Games. in the dream, i pull Hunger Games off of the shelf and out slips a paper thin cell phone. it is my sister's phone. she has recently come up from los angeles to visit and i know she's returned home while i was at work; clearly she's forgotten her phone. i'm amused, knowing how forgetful she can be, realizing that i'll now have a phone that i can use (my cell phone just died in real life - and in my dream too), and immediately call her husband on her cell to tell him that Sheila forgot her phone. before i can say anything, he says in a small voice, \\\"Where's Sheila? I've been calling her and you for hours. The boys are scared\\\". in the background, i hear the tv talking about murders. and then about plane crashes. and then about disappearances. i try to say something to him but my voice isn't working; i start to yell but nothing comes out. i know something has happened to her and i know that i have somehow failed her. my mind bends at the awful possibilities and i wake up, sweating.\\n\\nso i took down Hunger Games and suddenly flashed back to that short, dreadful scene of Katniss hearing her sister's name called during the reaping. i knew it was coming; hell, it says so right on the back cover. nevertheless, it is a scene that is in some ways a moment out of time for me. short, basic, horrifying, primal...the idea of Prim being chosen, being slain, is not even a possibility on Katniss' mind. her mind doesn't accept the idea of her sister in danger, and so without thinking, she volunteers to take her place. i remember reading that scene, and that little shiver it gave me. Katniss acts in the way that all people who love those in their care would act: immediately and unthinkingly putting themselves in harm's way to protect their loved ones. it is an automatic, human reaction. it doesn't take an expert on the human condition to understand that. but it does take an excellent writer to convey such a basic human response so simply and yet so meaningfully. Katniss' action defines her completely, as it defines all people who would seek to protect others. throughout the novel, she does not veer from this course.\\n\\ni was in alaska recently, camping. there was a person with us during this trip who was extremely worried abouts bears and bear attacks; and so conversation took place to reassure her, to keep things light. we talked about bears off and on throughout the day and then around the campfire. i've never been the sort to be paranoid about bears, but man when i went to sleep, that's all i could think about. and then twigs started cracking, followed by the sound of an animal snuffling and rustling about, right next to me; it happened throughout the night; i stayed awake until dawn. the next day i noticed some dry animal shit and discovered that i had placed my tent only a couple inches away from some little creature's burrow, one that clearly had much work to accomplish during the evening hours. not so frightening to think about now, sorta cute actually. but gosh, it is something else to be locked in fear for so many hours straight. my mind went through various stages, finally settling on a (now hilarious) acceptance that i would be attacked. i clutched my knife and waited, exhausted but somehow at peace that i could run, i could fight, i could live, i could die, but strangely content knowing that as ridiculous as this particular situation turned out to be, i have had that same feeling during other situations where i felt . this is a basic human response. you can only quiver in fear for so long until you weary, you become resolved to accept things.\\n\\non the plane ride back, i noticed a kid reading The Hunger Games and remembered my own enjoyment, and knew how gripping and intense the experience could possibly be for him. he certainly clutched the book as if his life depended on it, as if the rest of the world didn't exist. and then i also remembered those scenes in the arena, that acceptance that Katniss had: she may die, she may not die, but what will happen, will happen. i remember reading her thoughts about her future in the arena, her probable death, and realizing her thoughts . The Hunger Games manages to get across a very complex yet also very basic human response, in a way that is direct, crystal clear, and thoroughly realistic in its detailing of a person's actual mental and emotional reactions.\\n\\nso why do i ramble on about things in my life that have barely anything to do with Hunger Games, that only tangentially reminded me of this novel? well, i suppose to make a point about the book. if you are the kind of person who became lost in The Hunger Games, you know that it stays with you, it affects you in an emotional way...it comes back. but i'm also rambling to make a point about all quality Young Adult Fiction. this genre is well-loved, but it also takes its critical knocks as well. folks talk about the simplistic writing, the boiled-down tropes, the lack of complexity, the earnestness, and the basic, almost black & white palate of emotions and principles on display. but to me, . if done well, these are the reasons why these books connect with their readers in a way that feels right, that feels honest. no matter whether the setting is a wizard's school or an alternate england or a post-apocalyptic north america.\\n\\ni think of YA Fiction as our own modern version of fables and mythic adventures, stories that have as their purpose the telling of straightforward morality tales, tales of right and wrong and fighting back and loving others and being an individual and finding community. the best ones are transparent in their goals and do not clutter their prose with stylization, complicated narratives, writerly game-playing, ambiguous theme-building, and the like. the best ones tell a tale that resonates with readers at a deep and elemental level - and so the reader responds in kind. i suppose this is why many people can become obsessed with this genre's bestsellers - they speak to the reader in the most direct way imaginable. they may come with a context that is relevant to today's world (as does Hunger Games), but the best ones are also timeless (as is Hunger Games). the best of this genre warmly illustrates the strength of the human spirit yet can also be surprisingly unsentimental; often swiftly-paced and action-packed yet carefully, lovingly detailed when examining the things that matter to its protagonists; often despairing and full of a palpable sense of resentment and anger, yet open to the inevitable change and growth that can happen and that make us more connected to the world around us and to whom we truly are, at the heart of us.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games' place within all of this is obvious: it is a modern classic of the genre. and as with all classics, it is relevant and suitable for all ages. it is the kind of novel that grows in the memory.\"\n",

Katniss is one of the best YA protagonists to grace the page.. Cinna, Peeta and Haymitch are all a plus too. the idea of the hunger games is something that just can’t be replicated no matter how hard these newer books try. there’s so many iconic moments: Cinna making Katniss’ first dress, Peeta camouflaged in the bushes, Rue’s song, Katniss volunteering as tribute for her sister Prim, Haymitch’s “stay alive” advice.. the list goes on and on. i can’t wait to continue my reread.\\n\\n\\n\\nnow for the romance, Peeta is one of the few exceptions when it comes to blonde mmc’s. the way he so easily fell into the ruse of being down bad for Katniss (cause he lowkey always was) is sooooo cute. he balances Katniss’ black cat energy so effortlessly, the way she was yelling at him to make sure he didn’t die 😭 your honor, I LOVE THEM. i think there’s a certain charm to Kaniss and Peeta’s dynamic, they’re both so easy to root for with both the romance and them in general as the two tributes from district 12. i remember Catching Fire being my favorite of the 3, so looking forward to that one. being back in this world is making me so excited to finally get Haymitch’s book later on this year.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I started this book thinking the idea was preposterous: a government choosing to squelch rebellion by forcing its citizens to give up their children as contenders in the ultimate reality show of death to the last survivor. Yeah right, and yet it reminded me a lot of the absurdity of the Nazi party, child armies in Africa, and even back to the gladiators of the Roman empire. I realized I believed a government could be this arrogant and wrathful, that society could be this absurd, that the common people would be too afraid to fight back. When people are pitted against each other instead of turning on the establishment they often fight each other within the failed system, fighting for that elusive top spot or ignoring the pain of others grateful to escape tragedy themselves.\\n\\nI soon found myself intensely involved in the Hunger Games and hoping for a certain outcome that would certainly bring about the death of many children but save our brave heroine. Once you're in, what option do you have but to play and survive? Collins did an amazing job of taking an unbelievable and predictable storyline and making it believable and unpredictable. Complete with an impossible love interest, twists in the arena to keep you guessing, and both sympathy and hatred for the other characters, the book is hard to put down. I stayed up late to reach the conclusion that would seem obvious but was still evasive when I could conceive many alternate endings. In some ways the story reminded me of Lord of the Flies, but without as frustrating of a dues ex machina ending.\\n\\nI found it interesting that even in this life and death situation, the kids refused to do anything that would displease the Capitol and make them look rebellious or unwilling to play, or worse emotional and disturbed by death. They did not bond with each other, help each other, or ever want to be indebted by anyone's kindness. Sad that the gravest error would be vulnerability of spirit because the tough ones are the ones to survive. While Katniss gets out of having to do a lot of the killing, she still plays her part, and even being the cause of one death is too many. I found it interesting that they switch to survival mode and kill without thought or regret. I'm sure the regret and nightmares will come later, but we as the readers have to feel the sadness of the deaths now, and live with our own relief that a child died who wasn't Katniss. There is obviously a lot of death hashed out, but only a handful experienced by our narrator. There is one death that is rather gruesome, but for the most part, I thought the subject matter handled appropriately for YA. Nonetheless the subject matter is not appropriate for younger children.\\n\\nMy one compliant about the novel would be the overuse of fragments. As a grammar freak, I'll let powerful fragments go. On occasion. As a literary device. But you throw five and six back to back. Just for effect. And all I'm doing is counting. How many are going by before we're back to complete sentences. There were a few paragraphs with way too many. But that's just a style difference. And the story is worth it. A good tale and a thinker.\\n\\nEven after I closed this book, I found myself mulling over the statements about society, our gruesome need for reality TV, our shallow obsession with looks, how much a community will let others suffer as long as they are safe, and the strength of the human spirit when backed up against the wall. I enjoyed Katniss' emotionally detached character, Peeta's vulnerable goodness, and Rue's small but fighting spirit. Now I want to learn more about Gale. A good strong female protagonist and a great set up for the sequel which I will be reading. How will the Capital be brought down? Who will Katniss chose? Can she stand by and let another gruesome show go by training the tributes from her village without action? Can this society be saved or is it beyond redemption? I'm intrigued.\\n\\n\\nETA: I've been thinking a lot about the messages in the Hunger Games with all the hype for the movie. Good dystopias are warnings, something to make you mull over trends in society by making these public wrongs absurd and larger than life. Here are some of the comparisons I found between Panem and our society:\\n\\n-. The plastic surgery, the bright peacocky colors, the time and money spent primping, the obnoxious outfits that one could never work in or survive in come catastrophe. The shoes Effie Trinket wears in the movie are popular today and nobody can walk properly in them. Our obsession with looks is headed toward the unimaginable level of the Capitol. And the overindulgence doesn't stop at appearances. The overeating, the mcmansions, party-the-time lifestyle. Our shallow, keeping-up-with-the Joneses society is heading there.\\n\\n-. The people of the Capitol don't care where their resources come from, who works and dies for it, or how limited the supply is. They don't conserve; they don't say \\\"thank you\\\"; they don't look beyond themselves. The degree of separation from them and their food and resources means they have no appreciation for it. It's like us with our grocery stores full of already slaughtered food and the diamonds we were fought hard for in Africa. You can say the entitlement is a lesson for the 1% out there and you can say the entitlement is a lesson for the anti-1% who feel entitled for their government to support them. Even the poor in America are still better off than most of the world. We are all the 1% and the sense of entitlement from Americans could be our downfall.\\n\\n-. Reality TV, video games, gruesome movies (like the Hunger Games :) ) have desensitized us. As horrific as the Hunger Games is (not the book but the actual Games in a society), how far off are we when girls throw parties to watch other girls get their hearts broken on The Bachelor, or when we feel nothing as people starve through a month on Survivor, or break out in fights on shows on MTV. We stop shy of death, but how long before push the envelope there too? How long before a gladiator-style game becomes popular for us too? After all, we are following the footsteps of the Roman Empire. I've been reading articles on Yahoo! like crazy the past few weeks about how to do Katniss' braid or what food to eat in celebration of the movie release. We are as bad as the Capitol in some cases.\"\n",

Let them begin for real.”\\n\\n\\ni’ve never watched the movies. therefore i have nothing to compare it to besides the last time i read this. i will watch them eventually!\\n\\ni am so glad i got to read this book back in middle school. rereading this book gave me a sense of deja vu while reading some of the scenes. but wow my brain was really muddled while i read this. i definitely need to catch up on reading this series and find out everything before the entire series gets spoiled for me 🥲\\n\\ni thought the setting of this book was very interesting. i love the world building when it comes to dystopian books like this. my main problem with this book was how slowly the story moved sometimes and it became hard to read. however it did pique my interest with every chapter i read. it moved slow but captivated my attention in a way where i didn’t want to stop reading. it was also hard to stay motivated while reading this book, considering i was freshly out of a slump. i highly don’t recommend reading this book while in a slump.\\n\\n\\n\\ni loved the side characters, like cinna in this book. he was everything and he’s probably one of my favorites along with peeta. he was so supportive of katniss and reassured her when she needed it and truly tried his best to be there for her. i still have mixed feelings abt effie and haymitch bc they obviously can be good people but they have these bad qualities that taint their character and shape them. hopefully they have some redeeming ones in the upcoming books!!\\n\\nkatniss was the kind of character where she’s a realistic thinker and had trust issues which i believe are completely justifiable. however, her cluelessness felt like it dragged on way more than necessary after everything that peeta and her went through and i wished she got the hint earlier. i understand katniss’ trust issues with new ppl and how she was forced to hang out with peeta in the beginning but i feel so sad for peeta and how katniss was never able to sort out how she truly felt. i still loved her as a main character and i admired her determination. she was giving “you’re on your own, kid” by taylor swift vibes. the way she had to hold up her family and provide food meant that there was a lot of pressure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ni wish we got more of peeta and his personality. in the beginning, i was a bit skeptical of him just like katniss. it felt as though he secretly resented katniss bc of how his mom thought she had a better survival chance than him when quite the opposite was the case in the beginning. he still absolutely carried this book and brought the entertainment. the fact that he was only known as the boy with the bread throughout the story to katniss makes me sad. i absolutely loved them together and seeing both of their sides revealed at the end of the book really provided a lot of conflicting feelings which i loved. it was heart wrenching and sad, and i am so excited to continue with this series,\\n\\ntell me why this book was so confusing? people told me there’s a love triangle but not to mention the fact that she compared him to her like a brother. so after telling everyone that she sees him like a brother it turns out he’s holding her back at the end? where does he even come from. i also didn’t like how she compared little things that peeta did to gale!! gale was such a fucking bitch from the first few pages. however i do get how she could’ve liked him based on how they became friends over the years\\n\\ni love the bond between prim and katniss. it was so sweet bc it’s clear that they cared for one another greatly and the narrative didn’t primarily focus on the sister bond. katniss was a strong fmc from the start and she made her place clear (or tried to). she was so independent and learned to do things on her own after a near death experience with her family. they were never selfish and cared it was obvious they cared about family. she didn’t think for one second about how her life was more valuable than prim’s because of how strong their love was.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthere were so many cute scenes that katniss and peeta shared. one that i liked was when katniss adapted a small habit of peeta’s by dipping her rolls in hot chocolate. not to mention the way they both took care of one another when they were sick? it was so hard to not get attached to their story bc it was clear that it meant everything to peeta. he deserves the absolute world after everything that’s happened. i felt so bad knowing he was left out of the knowledge that everything was for show. that just left more sadness on his part and i think it shows how true and genuine he was through it all. i truly admire that.\\n\\nˏˋ°•*⁀➷\\nthe ballad of songbirds and snakes - tbr\\n\\ncatching fire - tbr\\nmockingjay - tbr\\n\\n\\n\\nI AM NEVER FORGIVING SUZANNE COLLINS FOR THAT ENDING. i miss my babies 😭😭 rtc\"\n",

The violence isn’t explicit and exists on the peripherals of what is otherwise a brilliant and captivating read.\\n\\nThe main character, Katniss, is incredible. She's strong, proud, clever, yet cold, calculating and soft. As far as great female characters go, she rivals Elizabeth Bennet and takes her thrown for my favourite ever. Where the Empress by Karen Miller was let down by a cold, calculating female character with no likeability, The Hunger Games is carried by Katniss' passion, determination and struggle.\\n\\nThe world itself seems unbelievable enough but if you can get past the concept of a government requiring a tribute of 12-18 year old boys and girls to take part in a gruesome bloodbath then you should be fine.\\n\\nThe supporting characters are rich and interesting. The world itself is three dimensional and tactile when reading and you will probably find yourself immersed in the science fiction world that doesn’t seem that distant from our own.\\n\\nThe plot and pacing never dulls and the end of the book may just cause heart palpitations as you race towards the end to discover who will survive and who will die.\\n\\nThe ending left me a little disconcerted but only because I wanted more.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"\\\"I want to die as myself ... I don't want them to change me in there. Turn me into some kind of monster that I'm not.\\\"\\n\\nKindness is the only act against which tyranny cannot prevail. Peeta Mellark, without violence or aggression, begins a rebellion that the world of Panem could have never stopped once it began. I've read this book so many times simply because of that message. I have never felt so much fear, and so much hope all at one time. The Hunger Games is about fighting for the freedom of choice, but more, it's about fighting for the freedom to love, and to live.\\n\\nFor the freedom to never fear.\\n\\nThe moment we meet Katniss, we understand what it is to survive. She hunts, and barters, and does everything she can to avoid a past that she fights to never repeat. She lives in constant fear of starvation and deprivation, her constant guide is finding a next meal. In that sense, there was not a single person more prepared to enter the games.\\n\\nTo grasp the true meaning of what it is to fight for your life, though, Katniss was the most unprepared person in Panem.\\n\\nIn every step leading up to the games, we watch Katniss fight to understand what the games are truly meant for. The obvious answers are control, fear, and punishment. She sees all of that, but she also recognizes it's about distraction and hope. Distraction from self, and hope for a better future. With the promise of a life of comfort, and the constant fear of never having enough, the games provide the entire country with something to root for, and something to hate. It binds them together as much as it tears them apart.\\n\\nWhat Katniss doesn't expect, is the simplicity of love. Did any of us really expect that?\\n\\nIf you have yet to set your eyes on this story, please don't keep waiting.\\n\\nThe true beauty behind these stories, for me, is how kindness can truly set the world on fire when it is honest. Peeta Mellark doesn't know how to be anything but.\\n\\nKatniss' rebellion is loud. In front of everyone, she commits the most true act of rebellion anyone could have imagined. She set a war in motion she was never ready to lead. Peeta's rebellion is quiet, and respectful, and so much more dangerous. He dares to love in a world that asks him to think of nothing but his own survival. He not only dares to love, but asks the world to love with him. He doesn't expect reciprocation, he only asks for the country to protect that love with their life, just as he would.\\n\\nIn the movie, President Snow states that, He mistakenly believes that Katniss is the hope of his nation, that her rebellion is what he has feared his entire life. He believes she is his end, but isn't it Peeta's own rebellion that gives her that power in the first place?\\n\\nPeeta is the hope of Panem, the voice of Panem, the future nobody thinks to ask for. Katniss is the symbol, the fighter, and the match. Together, they're a spark that can never be doused.\\n\\nI love The Hunger Games so much simply because it shows how true bravery, true fight... it starts with one act of kindness, and a constant belief in love. When Katniss believed in that kindness, she learned to fight. When she began to recognize that love, she started a war.\\n\\nWhat is probably the most important point made in this series, alongside Peeta's constant rebellion, is media perception. So like own media, it shows how influential information can be. How truth is always found in the constant lies. I so enjoy seeing the system upon which the games stand come to life. The idea of parading 24 teenagers around in costumes before they fight for their life, asking for them to show a nation who they are in only a few minutes, and testing their skill sets against their 23 competitors. It's unimaginable, and yet completely believable.\\n\\nAnd this is only the beginning. If The Hunger Games is a spark, Catching Fire is the fear that spark encourages. And Mockingjay, the proof of how powerful hope truly is.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Reread August 2024, probably my 3rd+ reread\\n\\nReread November 2022\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s been a long time since I first read The Hunger Games series. I remember loving it, and I love the films. After a movie marathon of the series on Black Friday I decided to revisit the books and it was such an amazing experience. I’ve have trouble reading physical copies of books the last six months, and I thought it was just me, but then I devoured the hardcover of this one with no problem, so hopefully I am cured.\\n\\nWe all know the story, I don’t need to rehash it. It is incredible to be that there are 7 million ratings of this book on Goodreads. It truly is a phenomenon. I read this book when it first came out, I think maybe in 2009 or 2010. I remember being so focused on the romantic relationship with Peeta, but now as an adult it was really so clear to me there wasn’t really a “romance” but just Katniss trying to survive. And I totally understood where she was coming from, we were in her head as readers and able to see her doubts and thoughts.\\n\\nI wasn’t a big reality tv watcher when I first read this book, but I have been a fan of it in recent years (especially the Real Housewives franchise) and I have to say, the reality tv aspect of this book disturbed me now more than ever before. When I was younger I thought that concept in the book was far-fetched and unbelievable. Now, it fits seamlessly with the story and I understood a lot of the decisions Katniss and Haymitch made because they knew people were watching. And it is incredibly unsettling.\\n\\nI am so glad I decided to reread this book and I will be rereading the other two as well. Catching Fire had always been my favorite, while Mockingjay was disappointing to me so I am wondering if my opinions of both of them will have changed.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"“Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor.”\\n\\nIt sure feels nice writing a review after not reading a book or writing a review for over a month.\\n\\nI'm honestly so glad I've actually managed to finish a book and I'm going to try very hard to get back into my reading schedule.\\n\\nBut anyways, this is one of the first series that got me into YA, which then proceeded to get me into reading in general and I'm very grateful for that.\\n\\nI first read this in 6th grade and as an impressionable little child I thought that it would be too violent for me and let me tell you that some parts of this book haunt me to this day, like it wasn't even terrible violence (to be fair, it probably was to 6th grade me) but some stuff still made me gag while rereading this.\\n\\nAlso, this reread was also partially to help me not fall for Young Snow in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes movie. DO NOT JUDGE OK I have a habit of falling for the bad guys if they're attractive. Let's just say, my problem has been fixed because Snow is disgusting and evil and I hate him.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo the plot overall for this book is great, action around every corner. Once you get to the actual Hunger Games part that is. Since this is a reread, I knew when the Hunger Games portion was going to start, so I wanted so badly to just skip to that part because, although I love the outfits and Capitol stuff, I came for the Hunger Games part.\\n\\nOnce you get into the Hunger Games, the book just has a way of keeping you on the edge of your seat, always saying \\\"oh I wonder who's going to die next\\\" or \\\"ouch that must have hurt\\\" or \\\"oh yeah that death was kind of gruesome not gonna lie\\\" and so forth.\\n\\nNow as for the stuff that I said traumatized me as a child:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo as for the characters, they're decent enough.\\n\\nI've come to learn that disliking Katniss actually isn't as rare as I thought, so I feel more comfortable with my thoughts of her.\\n\\nI really don't like her. I get that she's a 16 year old girl and some 16 year olds are like this, but like she annoyed me so much at some points with her whining. I feel like I can't really be saying all this stuff considering all that she has been through but that still doesn't excuse bad behavior. I will say, she is braver than I EVER can be. Like volunteering for the Hunger Games? I'd like to say that I'd do that but I don't think I could. (Is that cold hearted to say..?)\\n\\nNow Peeta is complicated. Not now, he isn't, I love Peeta now. But when I first read the book...brace yourself....I really liked Gale (IT'S CAUSE OF LIAM HEMSWORTH I SWEAR TO GOD). Which came with a hatred for Peeta, as that always seems to go with me and love triangles. So, when I was younger, I always got so annoyed with him and whined about him all the time because Katniss was paying attention to HIM and not GALE (I had issues I know) Now, Peeta is my lovely little bread boy and I love him <3 He's so much better in the books than in the movies too, like in the movies he's kind like a stale piece of bread (heh) but in the books he's got a personality.\\n\\nAs for the other characters, they were all fine. Haymitch and Effie are the other notable ones too, I really liked both of them.\\n\\nDo not talk to me about any of the other tributes, especially not a certain someone.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is where my unswayable opinions came in when I was in 6th grade. I was HARDCORE team Gale, and honestly kind of ashamed of it too after seeing all the Gale slander around, but nothing ever changed my mind because \\\"oH my GOSH Liam Hemsworth is soooo attractive.\\\"\\n\\nNow, I'm obviously team Everlark like no questions asked. I also feel like if I was brave enough to say I was team Gale whatever their ship name is, I'd get attacked (I swear I'm not) Katniss doesn't deserve Peeta, but no one deserves Peeta because Peeta deserves the entire universe.\\n\\nThank you 😌\\n\\n\\n\\nSo anywho, I love this series and if you haven't yet somehow read this series yet, I'd highly recommend it!

So I think I won’t be as active as I usually was. But I still usually check Goodreads a couple of times in a week!\\n\\nI actually have finished reading this book back in December 2019. But I didn’t have the time to review it until now. So here’s what I think of this book!\\n\\nI still remember years ago while I was in junior high school and I watched the movie adaptation of this book. I still remember how I loved it and my adrenaline was pumped throughout the movie and LUCKLY, I barely remember anything when I started to read this book nearly a month ago. It was not as amazing as I expected, BUT it wasn’t bad either. It was good actually. But not amazing.\\n\\nThe plot was honestly so intriguing. It was slow, but it wasn’t necessarily boring. But I would be happy, if the pacing of the book were much faster and this comes from a person who loves slow-paced books. But when the actions began. Wow. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time. It didn’t take me any effort to be engrossed in reading it. I followed Katniss’ adventure and it was both EXCITING and TERRIFYING. But unfortunately, I can’t say the same for the characters.\\n\\nI wanted to love the characters. To adore them or at least like them. However, the truth is, I don’t love them or hate them. I wasn’t really excited about Katniss or Petta. I didn’t form any kind of attachment to any of them. It was a bit frustrating because I wanted to be connected to them. But no. I didn’t feel anything for them. And the romance? I honestly don’t know what to say about it. Like totally at lost of words right now. The only thing that kept me going in reading the book instead of DNF-ing it was just the plot. It was thrilling. I don’t think I’ll read the sequels. I just don’t feel like I want to spend my time reading them. But anyway, it wasn’t entirely a bad book.\\n\\nIf you haven’t read this book, and you’re curious about it. I guess you should give it a try? It’s not the worst book I’ve ever read, but it wasn’t such a splendid book either. It was okay. Good enough.\\n\\n❤️😊\\n\\n•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\\nI’m reading this book for the first time! I watched the movie adaptation years ago, but fortunately I remember NOTHING! YAY! Hopefully, I’ll enjoy reading it.\\n\\nHave you read this book? Did you like it? (No spoiler!) 😊\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest\\n\\n\\nWhen I was in college, I got one of my friends to sign up for Goodreads with me and the two of us decided we were going to start our own Young Adult Book Club. We went to Target and bought the first three books in series when they were on sale and then as soon as we finished working on our papers and various assignments, we read.\\n\\n\\n\\nI stayed up all night reading THE HUNGER GAMES, as well as its sequel, CATCHING FIRE. It was unlike anything I had ever read before, with a really enticing battle royal format featuring a strong female heroine, a forbidden romance, and some surprisingly mature themes for a book aimed at the younger set. Some of the scenes in this book-- Peeta telling Katniss on the rooftop that he doesn't want the Games to change who he is, Katniss singing to Rue, the nightlock berries-- haunted me for . I loved it so much when I read it in my early twenties that I was afraid to pick it up again for fear that I wouldn't like it.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf anything, I enjoyed it even more the second time around. There were the scenes I remembered, but I couldn't believe how many scenes I forgot. Katniss is such a great heroine. She's strong and enterprising and selfish in a way that not a lot of heroines are allowed to be. Survival is always first and foremost in her mind, which makes sense, since romance is hardly something that should be clouding up her head when she needs to be fighting for her very life.\\n\\n\\n\\nI loved the scenes in the woods and how they paralleled the hunting scenes in the beginning of the novel. I loved how horrified Katniss is by the lavish displays of excess in the Capitol and how the only thing that really humbles her in a positive way is the food (holla). I thought it was interesting that District 12 appears to be in the South (Appalachians) and the Capitol is in the West (Rockies), like the author is suggesting that fucking Colorado or Utah would be the bastion of all this wealth and political power and not someplace like Washington D.C. or California. It made me realize how desperately I crave a book about the very first Hunger Games and the rebellions leading up to it, because I am curious to see how the disparity and power ended up being apportioned out this way.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE HUNGER GAMES ended up causing a HUGE craze in dystopian young adult novels. For a while, it seemed like authors were in constant competition to see who could destroy the world in the most creative ways. Would it be with drought? Gravitational disruption brought on by the moon? Economical poverty that could only be resolved with Bachelorette competitions? Vampires? Or would it be by creating a caste system via one-dimensional Myers-Briggs tests? *COUGH* THE HUNGER GAMES became huge enough that I think it was actually for many millennial and gen-Zers. Everyone has a magical world that ended up capturing their imagination when they were young, and while I was out of the age gate with this one, it still enthralled me.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was saying in a status update that too many authors try to milk their franchises dry, but in the case of franchise, I would gladly read books about every single game. There are so many hints at previous games in this books and I would love to read them all, whether it's Haymitch's book, a prequel about the rebellions, or the Russian winter-esque arena that ended up killing most of the combatants with frostbite. Honestly, if Collins writes it and it's about this world, I'd read it. If she writes it, and it about this world, I'd read it but I don't envy the woman that task, because you KNOW anything she writes is going to be immediately compared to .\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm not sure what else to say. This book still gave me all the feels and whether it was watching Katniss twirl in the dress on fire, sing a beloved friend to sleep, have her first kiss, or shoot some literal backstabbing bastard in the heart, I was with Katniss Everdeen every step of the way. This is such a perfect, well-done book and I'm happy to say it holds up just as well as the first time I read it.\\n\\n\\n\\nMay the odds be ever in your favor.\\n\\n\\n\\n5 stars\"\n",

Will she walk out of the Games alive?\\n\\nSo, I've been avoiding the Hunger Games for years. It has several strikes against it:\\n1. It's a young adult book\\n2. The enormous amount of hype\\n3. The fact that it appears on the surface to be a combination of two Stephen King books, and\\n\\nThe other night, I was talking about the Robert Crais book I just finished and my lovely girlfriend asked when I was going to start reading the Hunger Games. Monday, I said. She was making country fried steak that night. What else could I do? Lucky for me, the country fried steak and the Hunger Games were both great.\\n\\nSuzanne Collins crafted quite a tale in the Hunger Games. From the start, I was impressed with her lead characters. Katniss's personality reflected her background nicely. She wasn't cutesy or even particularly charismatic when the story started and was definitely rough around the edges. Peeta's questionable motivations kept the story moving for much of the book.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games themselves reminded me of the Stephen King books I mentioned earlier and also . I never had the safety net feeling that I had while reading other YA fare like Harry Potter. The way the story was told in the present tense gave it an urgent feel that kept me turning pages until my bedtime had come and gone.\\n\\nAny gripes?

After all, this whole book was insanely memorable and it sparked the following of so many similar stories that it would be near impossible to ever forget this.\\nIt’s become somewhat of a cultural reset and influenced the world of film and literature greatly, especially on the YA front. It truly marked the beginning of the great dystopian era, and I love it for that. Oh, what a time that was! Not to mention, this trilogy was, of course, also amazing all on its own.\\n\\nHowever, it does need to be mentioned that rereading these books just does not hit the same way as it does when you read it for the first time. If you already know the story so well, you’ll miss out on all the feelings of suspense, mystery and shock that this book would otherwise invoke so brilliantly! So really, it’s impossible to recreate the experience of reading this book for the first time with an open mind.\\nNonetheless, even without all those intense feelings of surprise, the book still had me gripped from beginning to end. The story is just so mind-boggling. It has one of the best premises I’ve ever seen.\\n\\nAlso, not unimportantly, Katniss is such an main character. It’s so refreshing to read a dystopian where the main character actually has their wits about them and has interesting skills that aren’t over the top, yet are still deeply invaluable. Katniss feels special but not to the point where she becomes special. She’s a badass and an icon. Truly.\\n\\nI do want to mention that, if there is one flaw I would have to name about this book, it is that the story itself feels better than the actual writing. With this I mean to say that the premise and the twists and turns of the story really are what make this book so engaging, and not so much the the story is written.\\nFor me, there was far too much inner monologue, and I also think certain scenes, relationships, events or even characters, could have been written with more underlying emotion and depth. For example, I never really bought into the romance part of this book, and I also didn’t feel a very deep connection to the characters. I feel like certain parts of this book could have held much more of an emotional punch, if only it had been more successful in its writing in that regard.\\n\\nAll in all, I think this book mostly shines in how well it executes the survival aspects, but also by how horrifying the dystopian world created here is. It’s not a perfect book, but it’s a classic from the early 2000’s and rightfully so.\\n\\n\\n\\n0. - 4.5 stars\\n1. The Hunger Games - 4.5 stars\"\n",

I love this book with all my heart and soul.\\n\\n\\nI don't even know how to put into words what this book means to me. The Hunger Games made me fall in love with the dystopian genre, with ya in general; it was the first book I ever read in English for fun (not my native language) and it sparked my interest in so many things...\\n\\nOnce I'd started reading THG, I just couldn't stop. I was pulled in by it, and completely lost in the story. The writing may not be the most detailed and exciting ever. It's straight forward without too many details or literary finesse, but it works. It's fluent, fast paced and easy to follow, and the world building is convincing and interesting. It's actually a bit scary because you start seeing all these similarities to our real world when you read this book (and even more so in its sequels). And, most of all, this book made me FEEL things. All the that hit me while reading it... I laughed, I cried, I was in the end. And no matter how often I read it, I cry every single time.\\n\\nKatniss may not be the most likeable character ever. She is flawed indeed, but she knows about her flaws and weaknesses and that's what makes her relatable. Being inside her head, we also get to know her as sassy and emotional at times. I was experiencing the story though her eyes, I saw what she saw and I could understand her motivations and thoughts. She's a great narrator.\\n\\nThe other characters are so unique and aswell, you can't help but let them into your heart even though they're not entirely likeable (take Haymitch for example, and I also have a soft spot for Effie). The book does a very good job of showing the reader the differences between Katniss's relationship with Gale vs Peeta and their respective strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nThe story is , it was unlike anything I'd ever read when I first read the book in 2013. But even now after having read tons of dystopias, no other book ever came close to THG. Suzanne Collins thought of a story so I can't do anything but salute her (with the 3 middle fingers of my left hand ofc). And while it's \\\"only\\\" a story, there's truth hidden inside these pages. Today maybe more so than ever, .\\n\\nMy initial fear of this book was it being too brutal/bloody for my taste. That wasn't the case. Of course it's brutal, but those scenes are usually over pretty quickly and only add to the story and help creating an atmosphere. Although if you compare the book to the movie, they definitely left the more gruesome details out in the adaptation for it to be rated PG-13.\\nThe story mostly follows Katniss trying to survive rather than fighting and killing her opponents. It's not only about strenght and brutality, it's about and . I loved the survival aspect and the feeling of home Katniss has in the woods. Even though her life is hard, she manages to find brief moments of happiness.\\n\\nSo now I've said everything I wanted to say. I can only add that there is a reason The Hunger Games is . Everyone should read this book! Because it's so much more than just any book... it's a reflection of our society and to me, it's also a warning.\"\n",

Okay so maybe not that much excitement is needed, but boy this book deserves a review I probably won't be able to give. There are plenty of good reviews of this book already, but I can't resist the urge to put my own two cents in too.\\n\\nYou can already get the premise of the story from the other reviews so I won't bother with that. Can I just say that the author did an exquisite job of finding the right voice for Katniss? I already like her and I struggle with her while she is playing the Hunger Games. Katniss does a lot of things that will cause some people's eyebrows to shoot up, but you have to remember she has to survive. Even though she does some things that seem not totally right you know her heart is more or less in the right place. She is 16 (an aged used a lot in young adult novels I'm noticing)and still figuring out her stand on the important things.\\nThe whole thing is kind of disturbing, but you can see the appeal it would have on audiences. I mean I got sucked into it so it isn't really that far fetched that people could actually become well... so morbid.\\n\\nIt's really hard for me to really get into what I want to discuss without giving away spoilers. I can say this though, the book had almost everything in it. Thrills, chills, suspense, humor (only a little but it's there), romance (kind of questionable I guess), struggle with identity, life and death situation (obviously), compassion and so much more that I'm sure I am missing.\\n\\nThe world Collins created is extremely believable, and the dilemmas that are presented are engaging and sometimes just painful to watch, but she pulls this off with ease. People just have to read the book themselves to comprehend what I'm trying to say. Needless to say I am agonizing over the wait for the next installment .\\n\\nFor those of you who didn't know there is a movie coming out! Oh gosh the excitement is too , is the link to the trailer.

One of them is \\\"The Hunger Games.\\\" I was finishing the book in the waiting room at the doctor's office and gasping out loud, laughing out loud, saying \\\"No -you are kidding me\\\" out loud - I couldn't help myself! The book appeals to those who enter a book through different doors. The PLOT door is exceptional - page turning action which is physical, emotional, and psychological. There is one plot twist after another. Boys will especially love this. The CHARACTER door, which may appeal more to girls, is also strong. The idea of survival versus relationships provides much food for thought. We get to know the characters well, and we invest in them. There is appeal in the SETTING and LANGUAGE doors as well. I don't hesitate to suggest the book to anyone, as there is no\\\"language,\\\" no sex, etc. The entire concept and the violence, however, may be disturbing to some. This book is by far my #1 book of 2008! Outstanding on all levels.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"September 2015 Updated Review\\n\\n\\nI had initially put off reading the Hunger Games for years because:\\n1. Dystopian fiction gets on my nerves.\\n2. People were declaring it “the next Twilight”. *cringe*\\n3. The description talked of poverty and politics, which made me suspect that the book would be a lecture on the author’s political views.\\n\\nAll of the above reasons get an automatic “Nope” from me. I saw the movie though and thought it was alright, it didn’t seem to be the spectacle that everyone else described as “ahmazing”. I’ll admit that the trailer for did pique my interest enough to give the books a try. Well that, and the social prodding.\\n\\nSo I read it, and it wasn’t as God awful as some other YA books out there in the same genre. I mean, seriously, have you read some of that other stuff? It’s terrible! Add dystopia to the mix and it sells like hotcakes - and still annoys the [expletive deleted] out of me.\\n\\nWhich brings me to my first point: the dystopia presented in the is somewhat believable. Yes, it is a social commentary about the current financial crises in America today blah blah blah, but at least it isn’t some “outbreak that kills most of the population” [expletive deleted] story that other authors are peddling out at the moment.\\n\\nSecondly, I’m glad the “love story” takes a backseat. Katniss is actually a heroine who has balls. She isn’t the tough-as-nails female protagonist archetype that other “girl power” novelists love to create, but neither is she a Mary Sue. Her strength and determination come from desperation, from having been thrust into the role of the provider for her family and then trying to survive the barbarian Hunger Games. She questions Peeta’s motives like a smart girl should instead of being caught up in a whirlwind romance that presents itself.\\n\\n\\nThirdly, I’m glad this didn’t turn out to be a “and all this mess happened because we elected [insert name of real life despised candidate] for president” kind of book. When a storyteller does that it just makes me lose respect for them when they infuse their own radical political beliefs into a story in order to scare people to vote their own way. didn’t.\\n\\n\\nOn other notes, how can a foodie like myself read a book called the \\\"Hunger Games\\\" and NOT comment on the food? MMM, goat cheese and apple slices on a roll… Lamb stew with plums – DAFUQ? No, just no. To put fruit with meat just seems like it goes against nature. Unless it is Orange Chicken, that stuff is delicious y’all.\"\n",

I did not know that since I left that idyll & phantasmagoric kingdom penned graciously by maestro R. L. Stein nothing with the exception of the Potter books has been added to the canon for the benefit of modernday intellectually-growing young adults. The...shame...!\\n\\nSo, first off, anyone interested in GOOD dystopian lit should immediately go to Margaret Atwood's fantastic MaddAddam Trilogy (\\\"Oryx and Crake\\\", \\\"The Year of the Flood\\\"...) for an actually experience, not a half-assed, half-baked panoramic half-world, but a wondrous, fully-alive universe which holds in store \\\"muttations\\\" far more terrifying than Collins's. If you want romance on that scale of lametude, check out the \\\"Twilight\\\" saga…!\\n\\nNow, that being the worst of it (it may be a deal breaker for some folks) the novel is rife with ideas, (ideas and concepts such as revolution, causes for catastrophe, skills for survival, mass media coverups, etc.) most of which have been previously encountered in other YA novels, like the aforementioned boy wizard ones. The self-centered tone is ideal for teens encountering the novel concept of novel reading. How can, in this hell where kids kill kids, girls still gush about fashion and boys? Don’t make no sense 2me!\\n\\nArgh-- There’s way better stuff out there, kiddos! (Sorry, G--Still, I’m sticking around for the 2nd one.)\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Hunger Games is a YA sensation trilogy of books that were turned into mega-successful films making Jennifer Lawrence a trillionaire. My kid read all of them in French this summer and wanted me to read them in English, so I did!\\nIt is a dystopian future in post-apocalyptic America called Panem where the remains of the country is divided into 13 Districts, each handing one pre-defined piece of the economy under harsh surveillance with no freedom of expression. The ruling class in the Capitol created a media event called Hunger Games where one male and one female \\\"Tribute\\\" are \\\"reaped\\\" from each district and sent into an arena to fight to the death until there is a single victor - all shown live on mandatory television to citizens of Panem. Kitness, the narrator later played by Lawrence, who is 16 years old and knows how to hunt really well with a bow and arrow, volunteers to replace her sister at the Games (Vol 1). She wins and learns that her victory sparks a revolution (Vol 2 - Chasing Fire) which presumably pans out to eliminate the oppressors (Vol 3 - Mockingjay).\\nIn terms of writing, plausibility and sentimentality, it is heavy handed and predictable. However, after I discussed the series with a kid's librarian at the American Library in Paris, I came to see her point of view as using the book to teach a few valuable lessons to my son: the themes of the dangers of reality TV, fighting oppression, freedom of expression, and strong unconventional female characters are all well-handled and very topical in these days we live in!\\nAs for the first volume, we are introduced to Katniss' Panem District 12 prior to her reaping - an oppressed mining community where authorities turn a blind eye to her hunting with childhood friend Gale and to the thriving black market (the Hob). However, the idyllic bit doesn't last long as she is thrust rather quickly into the arena against the 24 other tributes. In terms of action, I felt it got bogged down at several points (particularly in the cave). Also, the Peeta vs Gale bit wore on me (and became a theme throughout all three books of course). That being said, from my son's perspective, the rhythm of the book was perfect. Another cool bit I suppose, was the high tech stuff that Collins throws in - makes for a decent sci-fi aspect.\\nSo, I am kind of on the fence on whether I'd give this 3 or 4 stars. My kid would give it 5. I'll split the difference and call it a 4 in terms of teaching some values with which I agree and this without becoming too imbibed with stereotypes or tropes. It is highly original, even if for older readers, it might feel pedantic at times.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"By now most people have formed an opinion of this book based on it or on the movie, and you've gathered my rating that I liked it a great deal. I do have some thoughts I want to share.\\n\\nPlenty of people have pointed out (or complained) that the moviemakers go to a great deal of trouble not to show the contestants, including Katniss, killing one another. If you think about it, though, Katniss doesn't do a lot of killing herself. I think Collins was being very careful--if Katniss had been more of a killer in these games, parents would have screamed the ceiling down.\\n\\nBut here's the thought I want to put out there. I wonder if Collins wasn't thinking more of Joan of Arc when she wrote Katniss: Joan, whose family was brutalized by English soldiers, who had a vision of a free France. Admittedly, the vision isn't Katniss's, but it's almost as if the vision of Katniss is the spark that the crushed people of Panem need to rise up. They'd had Games before and there wasn't a vision that caught them until the warrior girl was put before her. Yes, Katniss is maneuvered into things by the men in her life, particularly Haymitch, but once she gets mad, she has a knack for drawing people to her banner--like Joan.\\n\\nSo call me bersorkey, I don't mind. Just thinkin me thinks. Back to my own war (on paper).\"\n",

I was in 10th grade, and devastatingly I did not have anyone to talk to about this crazy story I'd stumbled across. So naturally, I sat my mother down & told her every plot point in excruciating detail.\\n\\nNow, almost a decade later, there's a lovely sense of nostalgia that comes with picking this up again. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to trust my 15-year-old self's opinion on this, that tiny me was not delusional!\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm sure by now, you all know the story, so I won't waste time giving a brief summary. Also, I should mention that due to the widespread popularity of this series is, I will not be marking any spoilers I may discuss.\\n\\nSo here's your\\n\\nOne of the things that is particularly special to me about this series is that District 12 happens to be located in the same geographic region of North America where I currently live. Being the home of main character, Katniss Everdeen, we get a more detailed look at it than of the other Districts.\\n\\nThe residents of District 12 are mainly poor, responsible for mining & exporting coal product & shipping it to the Capitol. This isn't too far off of conditions that currently exist in may parts of Appalachia.\\n\\nI feel as though Collins does an describing how the nature of poverty breeds an intrinsic lack of understanding one's own self-worth & simultaneously a fierce sense of protectiveness.\\n\\nSafeguarding the handful of important things in one's life becomes a sole purpose for survival, and this behavior is expertly established in Katniss as she deals with the death of her father, the emotional absence & mental illness of her mother, & becoming the sole provider for what's left of her family all by the age of 12.\\n\\nThere's a realism here for me, as it's not an uncommon story & it's one I imagine many people can relate to on a personal level. Collins quickly introduces our main character, defines what is important to her & what makes her life worth living. The circle of introduction closes with Katniss making the ultimate sacrifice to save her younger sister's life & volunteer for the Hunger Games in her stead.\\n\\nAcross all the Young Adult books I've read between my first & second reading of , I've seen many an author struggle to succinctly create an effective, realistic main character like Katniss in such a world.\\n\\nNow, I'm sure there are scholars all over who have written essays upon essays about the themes present here: love between siblings, perseverance against insurmountable odds, mercy, mass indoctrination, government corruption, etc. There's to dissect. At this point I feel as though going deeply into these themes would be beating a dead horse, but there's no doubt they all contribute to an reading experience.\\n\\nIt's this combination of important subject matter, the contrast of children being made to fight to the death and the culture of the Capitol that\\n\\nNow, I must mention that there is one aspect of this book that\\n\\nThat aspect is Peeta's instalove for Katniss. I know, I know, he loved her since he was five I guess? But that detail feels just for the sake of creating early drama.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe didn't Peeta entering the scene with existing feelings for Katniss, and we didn't need Katniss having fluttering feelings about Peeta so soon. It would've been perfectly believable for Peeta to slowly develop feelings after the spark of being the only two tributes to survive the same Hunger Games, and for readers to fall in love slowly with Peeta as Katniss does.\\n\\nIt's my humble opinion that Peeta doesn't hold a candle to Gale in terms of compatibility with Katniss, even if my personal choice would be Peeta, but that's a discussion for later book reviews!\\n\\nAnother thing, I believe this series would benefit greatly from not being published under the Young Adult genre. There is already a substantial amount of devastating reality to sort through here, This is a critique I have for all my favorite Young Adult books, though, so take that commentary with a grain of salt!\\n\\nOtherwise, this was a wonderful re-read experience & I'm chomping at the bit to read , which was my favorite of the three books back in the day!\\n\\nSpecial thanks to & for reading this with me! ♡\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"We'll be talking about this entire series and its adaptations in an upcoming episode of Snark Squad Pod. Stay tuned!\\n\\nI don't quite remember when I read this for the first time, only that it was a some point before the first movie came out. I've only read it once, (and attempted to reread it once before, but didn't get far) but this story in general is one that (thanks largely to the movie adaptations) has infiltrated pop-culture and has a large presence in my feelings. I've talked about this book highly, and so coming back to it some 8-10 years later, older, wiser, a different media consumer, and currently stuck inside in the middle of a pandemic was wild.\\n\\nWhat I'm saying is that this hits different in 2020. And it still slaps.\\n\\nIt's hard for sure to separate all of the larger ways this story already lives in my feelings, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I found this to really hold up. The most I can say against it is that in general, the language is simple, though I think that's part of what makes it accessible. I can imagine that others might also take issue with the simplicity of the concept\\n\\nThis read, I was struck by these things:\\n\\n- For a book called The Hunger Games, I'm positive I did not track the presence of food the way I did during this read. It's pervasive. Collins builds her world around food, the getting of it, the presence of it, the waste of it. She constantly draws parallels between the ways the government more overtly kills its people (the actual games) and the way it consistently kills its people (hunger). It's effective and, again, accessible and just wonderfully done.\\n\\n- It's pandemic brain, I know, and the fact that certain of our political leaders have as good as said they would sacrifice grandma to the stock market at this point, but I kept tracking all the ways Collins kept checking in with us to give her games believability. The tesserae, for instance, were a detail I had forgotten that was just a gut punch. Of course this is a system that disfavors the poor. All of the pre-game details stood out to me as well. The interviews, the parade, the training-- they were the bits that most currently favor our own ideas of reality TV and grounded the wildness of the actual Games.\\n\\n- This is a story about the collective grief of a struggling society, about the ways that a government can keep people apart and inherently against each other, and certainly about PTSD. It was gutting to see the different depictions of PTSD, in Katniss, in her mom and in Haymitch.\\n\\n- Katniss is fascinating. She just cannot process, from even before the games, that people care for her. She cannot imagine bright futures, whether that's running away with Gale or having children or not living in District 12, or winning the games. She cannot process that the people in 12 like HER, that Madge is her friend, that she is impressive and able. She's frustrating sometimes, but also cares for hers so deeply, is so capable, and so easy to understand that you forgive her and obviously you cheer her on, even when that means that Collins has trapped us into cheering on the murdering of children.\\n\\nThere were so many other things, so many moments I loved, so many emotional beats. It's well-paced, engaging, emotional, and truly just a wonderful book.\\n\\n[March 31, 2023] Marked for reread\"\n",

It has been a pleasure.\\n\\nI remember the first time I watched the movie, I was in a plane and I really liked the trailer of this one, and I just started watching it when I saw the age limit. I was underage, but obviously that didn’t stop me, I just had to keep it a secret (stupid, now that I think about it). I loved it, and the next movies too. I recently binged watched the trilogy again with my sister and I just knew that the books couldn’t wait anymore.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor those of you who don’t know, Hunger Games are set by the Capitol as a punishment for a rebellion by the Districts long ago. Every year, a boy and a female tribute are chosen to compete in the Games where the tributes fight each other to death, until a single victor emerges. This is to remind the Districts that the Capitol controls them and they have no say as to what happens to their children: if they are chosen. The Capitol provides security-which mostly ends up in dead innocent people; and in return, everything the districts make is taken by the Capitol. Also, communication between districts is prohibited. We follow Katniss who lives in District 12 of Panem with her mother and her little sister, Prim. She takes care of bringing the food to the table by hunting outside the fence (which is illegal) with her friend Gale after her father’s death. The book starts on the day of Reaping (the process through which tributes are chosen), Katniss and her little sister go for attendance and you’ll have to read it to know more :)\\n\\nSo… what did I find? That Hunger Games can have some occasional jokes? That Peeta is so much more loveable and understandable here? That Gale and Katniss weren’t always friends? That Katniss’s mom wasn’t always so damn numb? That Katniss didn’t really hate Peeta from the beginning? Yes, yes, yes! Okay, this was so good. It was so much more than a movie and combined, it makes an awesome mix. The writing is easy to follow and you almost immediately lose yourself in it, it’s that natural. The characters are fun and likeable, and most importantly understandable.\\n\\nAs I said earlier, I really get to love Gale, Peeta and Katniss-even Haymitch, Cinna, Rue, and Effie- more through this book. Though I was completely aware of the main spoilers, there were details that the movie (as movies go) missed. It was fun to get to know the characters in another way, and some things that were left unanswered by the movie or ignored were explained. I have already come to love Katniss and even enjoy her for her rage and childish stubbornness so it didn’t annoy me. I finally have the true motive of everyone which wasn’t so clear in the movie. I think there was a little less of Prim, but that’s only reasonable. There is a lullaby in here that really made me cry, and I didn’t know a small detail that changed everything at the last page of this book. (For a spoiler review, see the spoiler under Chapter 27). One thing that I missed here was multiple POV. In the movie, we see what’s happening on the outside too; but here, though everything was explained, I found myself wishing for a POV of Snow and of Gale and Peeta, but don’t worry, Katniss doesn’t disappoint.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 1:\\n\\n\\nChapter 2:\\n\\n\\nChapter 3:\\n\\n\\nChapter 4:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5:\\n\\n\\nChapter 6:\\n\\n\\nChapter 7:\\n\\n\\nChapter 8:\\n\\n\\nChapter 9:\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 10:\\n\\n\\nChapter 11:\\n\\n\\nChapter 12:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 13:\\n\\n\\nChapter 14:\\n\\n\\nChapter 15:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 16:\\n\\n\\nChapter 17:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 18:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 19:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 20:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 21:\\n\\n\\nChapter 22:\\n\\n\\nChapter 23:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 24:\\n\\n\\nChapter 25:\\n\\n\\nChapter 26:\\n\\n\\nChapter 27:\"\n",

Some issues are left unanswered at the end of this first book, but overall I think that it's pretty consistant for a YA dystopian.\\n\\nFinally (because I want to keep my review to a minimum), to picture a female lead who is strong but relatable, who focuses on her goals but is also able to care for others - yet not for , which is great, because it wouldn't be believable now would it?\\n\\n\\n\\n► .\\n\\nThe used to make my picture can be found\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Exquisitely brilliant!\\n\\n\\\"HOPE IS THE ONLY THING STRONGER THAN FEAR\\\"\\n\\nI simply adored the book, hence the 5 stars rating! I loved the characters: Rue, Hayymitch, Katniss and I completely identified with Peeta Mellark! Easily read, fast-paced, it took me less than 20 hours (in total) to read it.I don't know why I had been waiting so long to read this.. And now that it's finished I am so sad...\\n\\nKnowing that this is a trilogy, there were no big surprises. Don't expect big twists and turns. The reasons you will love this book are different. On reading the book synopsis on the back cover of the book (twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to appear in a live TV show called the Hunger Games. There is only one rule: kill or be killed), you realize that the story premise is properly conceived. Collin's passionate writing combined with this flawless structure is what will make you unable to put this book down! Another reason I loved the Hunger Games is because of the themes that stretch through our story. Wealth and poverty, beauty and appearances, government controlling the masses, violence and death as entertainment. A depiction of the cruelty of the world we live in, in the form of epic dystopian fantasy. That's what this book is about... Finally I loved the Hunger Games because among all these major profound themes, there is the element of young innocent love which always works its way into our hearts even at the darkest times of mankind.\\n\\nHighly recommended!\\n\\nI am now going to watch the film! ;)\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Court is in session. Silence in the court! The Honourable Judge Goodreads presiding.\\n\\nFor the defence: Various Readers\\n\\nFor the prosecution: Ms Traveler\\n\\nThe charges: 1)Being badly written, and\\n2)Setting a questionable moral standard for children, who might be mislead into thinking that killing, and killing games between humans, are glamorous.\\n\\nVarious Readers: Your Honor and members of the jury, MS Traveler has made despicable charges against the defendant, The Hunger Games, firstly, that it is badly written, with a poor premise, poor plot structure, and clumsy style. We reject this claim totally and completely, because THG is the best book we've ever read, for sure!\\nAlso, we've recently seen pointed out to us some examples of writing that are pretty much worse than you find in THG, I tell ya!\\n*submits evidence* and\\n\\n\\nHis Honorable GR: Is that all you have to say on the first charge, Various?\\n\\nVR: That is all for now, Y.H.\\n\\nHHJGR: Ms Traveler?\\n\\nMs Trav: Well, your Honor and members of the court, I have to concede VR their last point. There have indeed been works published that are more badly written than this one, but, keep in mind that this book is even being used in schools, and I very much doubt that the self-published novels mentioned would ever attain that status (Well, I certainly hope not, the day that happens, I think I shall buy a bottle of gin and get very, very drunk.) Oh, er... apologies to the court. *bows*\\nMy first contention is that the author used a very clumsy style. I've consulted the advice of some authors/teachers giving advice regarding creative writing, and this is what they have to say:\\n\\\" \\\"He said\\\" and \\\"she said\\\" - this type of attributives, when used with expressive dialog that speaks for itself, may be unnecessary, especially if there is other action text which makes it clear who is speaking.\\n\\nFrom a piece of advice elsewhere: \\\" When two characters are speaking, attributives are only necessary for the characters' first appearances.\\n“That’s an attractive hammer,” he said.\\n“A family heirloom,” she said.\\n“I never would have guessed.”\\n“You don’t look like the guessing type.”\\nThe reader will keep track of “he said” and “she said” after the preliminary exchange. Further attributives will slow down what promises to be an interesting conversation. \\\"\\n\\nI will grant VR this, that at least MS Collins didn't make the mistakes we saw in some of the other novels mentioned in evidence submitted above, such as :\\nMany writers try to think for the reader by replacing “said” with words like grunted, growled, demanded, bellowed, cooed, roared, squalled, and simpered. If the tone of the dialogue is not immediately apparent, rewrite the dialogue and not the attributive.\\nThis goes double for adding adverbs like belligerently, arrogantly, haughtily, angrily, coquettishly, happily, slavishly, and jokingly.\\n\\nI supose a lucky happenstance and by-product of the 1st person present tense being used, is that it's going to sound REALLY clumsy when you say:\\\" Remember, I tell myself . You’re the hunter now, not them. \\\"\\n\\n..so at least there is not too much of that in THG.\\nHowever, Ms Collins doesn't see the superfluity of dispensing with \\\"I see\\\" I guess\\\" \\\"I hear\\\" \\\"I imagine\\\" \\\"I feel\\\" \\\"I decide\\\" \\\"I spot\\\" \\\"I detect\\\" \\\"I think\\\" \\\"I perceive\\\" \\\"I judge\\\" etc.\\nExamples:\\n\\n\\n..but for me the worst offender was \\\"I think.\\\"\\nThis is 1st person present tense, so it should be quite obvious that she is thinking, correct? This is part of what makes the point of view so awkward. How is it that one is looking in on somebody's thought processes? ... it becomes even stranger if the narrator keeps reminding you that she is \\\"thinking\\\".\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\netc. etc. etc.\\n\\n..and of course the perpetual : he said, she said.\\n\\nHowever, your honor and members of the jury, I personally wish that 1st person present tense would be shot at dawn. *Cough* er.. I request that remark to be disregarded for the official record.\\n\\nBasically, I found this long-winded, uneconomical narrative so booorring and pedestrian, that I had to keep whipping myself to stay with it. The only reason I managed to push through to the end, is because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. This plot could have been delivered much more efficiently in about 2/3 of the amount of words that it took Collins to get there.\\n\\nSecondly, I would like to point out some features of the plot. The \\\"kids killing kids \\\" aspect has been so obviously ripped off from , that it doesn't even require demonstration. The fact is obvious. However, a little problem or two creeps in with the setting.\\n\\nWe find ourselves in a future America where a central regime has subjugated the rest of America and somehow managed to divide commerce and industry up into as follows, per 'district' (District 1 does luxury items, District 4 does fishing, etc.):\\n\\n1. Luxury Items\\n2. Unknown\\n3. Factories\\n4. Fishing, anything sea-related.\\n5. Unknown\\n6. Unknown\\n7. Trees, AKA lumber and etc.\\n8. Textiles (clothing)\\n9. Generates electricity\\n10. Raises livestock & cattle for eating\\n11. Agriculture\\n12. Coal Mining\\n13. Graphite/Nuclear Weapons\\n\\n...so.. each area of the US is now divided into a geographical area that supports only one industry; most of which are known, but some are not, as demonstrated in my list.\\nWell... -agriculture - only one single area? ... and livestock makes up one of 12 equally divided up districts ?\\n\\\"Oh my!\\\" as Ana Steele would have said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*Ms Trav points to a map showing the current distribution of agriculture in the United States of America.*\\n\\n\\nTo utter another Ana Steele-ism: \\\"Oh crap\\\". It would appear as if Ms Collins bunked some of her Geography lessons...\\n\\n*chuckles* Also, the fishing district must be one pretty loonng, thin area, I'm thinking.\\n\\nAlso, one wonders which one of the blue areas on this map would be District 11? *points to*\\n\\n..and Ooooohhh, Myyy, I guess a lot of factories went defunct after Panem became the capital...\\n\\nWell. So, somewhere in the middle of that map, is an area where nobody does absolutely anything, except watch television all day long, and strut about wearing weird make-up. Excepting for their amaaa-zingly technologically advanced military force, of course. This military exists for the main reason of keeping the 'districts' subjugated.\\n\\n\\nThey keep themselves busy by tracking down escapee kids and cutting their tongues out.\\nI can quite get the point that VR makes when they see metaphors for the super-rich in Panem, and social classes and industries in the populace of the 'districts', but this councilor has a hard time envisaging exactly how the logistics of dividing these demographic strata into separate geographical areas would be managed.\\n\\nHowever, Your Honor, I think we are running out of time, since there are really a whole bunch of much better books that I'd like to get to reading; so I would like to move on to the second charge, if we may.\\n\\nHHJGR: Certainly. Councillors VR?\\n\\nVR: We would like to put forward various reasons why we think Ms Trav's claims fail.\\nOne of our arguments: [argument 1]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother popular argument amongst many of our female proponents, [argument 2]is that Katniss is so kickass, that we should actually applaud her savagery because at least she's not portraying the despised stereotype of a helpless, passive, submissive female.\\n\\nA third argument, [argument 3] is:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*VR submits the following document regarding argument 3 above*:\\n\\nVR: That is all we have time for, in the space given, I am afraid.\\n\\nHHJGR: Ms Trav?\\n\\nMs Trav: Thank you, your Honor.\\n\\nWe shall start by addressing the arguments one and three together. In deference to argument 3, we have read the Human Rights Watch World report for 2009, which seems to be the latest published report we could find.\\n\\n4 of the main English speaking parts of the world, Britain, (and this councilor would personally disagree with such an omission - though irrelevant for purposes of this court case) new Zealand, Australia and Canada were not even included in the report. The US was included, for the death penalty, for detentions and circumstances pertaining thereto, and issues regarding refugees and \\\"unrecognized citizens\\\".\\n\\nNothing in there about using child soldiers, but there is a separate report published about using child labor on farms. Oh really. This councillor's heart bleeds for children who are made to work a little (while still attending school), instead of becoming helpless, rude, molly-coddled brats. Also for children who lie about their age. That sound too conservative for you? Well, guess what, this councillor never thought that a bit of work hurt anybody.\\nHowever, she does agree that there should be an age limit of at least 12 years old (with very restricted hours - no more than 14 hours a week at such young ages). ..so, while agreeing that better monitoring should be instituted in this area, keep in mind that this is purely agricultural work (strictly no manufacturing) like seasonal veggie and fruit picking we are talking about here.\\nHaving your child help out during harvest time isn't the worst idea in the world. I made my kids help me in the garden at age 6 and they loved it! (So shoot me for having my kids do some weeding and helping to pack a pebble garden) .\\nI think it's character building, not to mention fun, so I don't quite see what is so terrible about the practice, as long as it's practiced in moderation and doesn't affect school work in any way. .. the point is that the above, in no way correlates to being forced to kill other children at ages as young as 12 years old - let alone humans of any age forced to kill innocent civilians in a non-war zone!\\n\\nThis councilor also read the report on child soldiers. No child soldiers amongst the main audience who would be reading this book, in the countries mentioned above, if you count \\\"children\\\" as being younger than 16y 6m.\\nIn the US, Australia, Britain, and Canada, although being allowed to enlist at younger ages, no persons are allowed to serve on active duty until reaching age 18.\\n\\nMost of the countries where children under the age of 18 are allowed to take part in active fighting, are situated in the African and Arab world; and some in South America, Asia and Eastern Europe, but none of the people who make them fight could qualify as a real-world equivalent of the opulent, leisured, consumerist and entertainment oriented class of people depicted by THG's Panem.\\n\\nSo I fail to see the relevance of the intended target audience for this novel to the countries employing child soldiers, who all fall outside of the ambit of both this books' intended readership, as well as the geographical areas or societies depicted within the novel.\\n\\nSo, as for argument 3, I simply fail to see the connection . Sorry. VR are welcome to point out the connection more clearly, but they would certainly need to submit more evidence, in this councilor's opinion.\\n\\nNow, regarding argument 1, and this councillor's accusation that this book is inappropriately targeted towards children as young as 9 (who are reading it in droves) to fully appreciate the moral implications of the material.\\n\\nIt's as simple as this: Katniss is depicted as a glamorous, sexy, kick-ass character whom girls and boys could identify with. (Do a little test, imagine that Katniss is a boy and Peeta is a girl. See how it could still work? )...and even if you keep Peeta a boy, boys could still identify with him, since he is portrayed just positively enough to make him a character possible to identify with: he is street-smart, physically strong, and socially savvy.\\nSo, despite all of Katniss's infuriating social bluntness and her lack of social skills, Peeta is her foil, and together they make a sparkly couple.\\nOnly, they have zero moral backbone (in the first book at least) - they simply go along with the whole routine of falling in with the faceless oppressors who want to be entertained by seeing them kill innocent children, some as young as 12 years old. Sure,\\n(This part was wisely excised out of the film, where neither Peeta nor Katniss kill anybody.)\\n\\nNow, me, if someone forced me to kill at least one innocent child, even while they were holding a gun to my head, I would say: \\\"Go ahead, shoot.\\\" Really? Really. Why? Well, because if they didn't shoot me before I did such a heinous thing, I would certainly shoot myself after doing such a heinous thing, simply because I wouldn't be able to live with myself after doing this - I would despise myself too much. Do I know this for a fact? Yes, I know this for a fact. Therefore, I'd much rather show the middle finger by saying \\\"NO!\\\" to such and act, and let them shoot me, than to actually align myself with such douchebags and go through with such an act merely for their entertainment ...I just couldn't live with myself if I did that.\\n\\nVR: OBJECTION!\\n\\nHHJGR: VR?\\n\\nVR: In the following novels they DO object and rebel! ..and like we said before, Katniss and Peeta both say they don't like the idea...\\n\\nMs Trav: Your Honor, it may be the case that they rebel in novels, but we are currently reviewing novel. This councillor would be happy to rate the later novels based on their own merit.\\n\\nHHJGR: Objection denied, regarding the later novels. Ms Trav, what is your rebuttal of the second part of the objection?\\n\\nNOTE:\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"“Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor.”\\n\\nThis is the first time I've wrote a review for The Hunger Games, so this is my pre-warning to you it will be more than likely me just crying about how much I love this series and that Peeta is perfect and that I love him so much because he loves Katniss so much. Just need to set your expectations here because this book fills me with so much happiness and fond memories!\\n\\nA little back story to this, I first read The Hunger Games like a month after the film was released, I was just getting back into reading and the story obviously intrigued me. I was a sucker and drawn in and just HAD to read the books/series to find out what was going to happen to these characters that I liked. Turns out, when I read it for the first time in a very very long time I fell head over heels with the books, the characters and just everything. I mean I have a \\\"Real, or not real\\\" tattoo that's how much I love this series. I haven;t read this series in over four years I believe, and when the films came out I used to go every midnight showing with my friend Lewis because we were both in love with anything relating to Te Hunger Games! So I'm going to try and attempt to write a review, but I just wanted to shed a bit of light into my back story with my love for The Hunger Games a whole.\\n\\nWhere to even begin with writing a \\\"fresh\\\" review of this. There is a lot that goes on, these characters have to deal with an array of things from Katniss and Peeta coming to terms with having to enter The Hunger Games, severe poverty, Haymitch and his issues with Alcohol, how much power the Capitol has, the loss of loved ones and SO much more. I think what the story does so well is that these are serious matters, but you do get glimpses of hope and slight happiness, and hope is a very powerful thing in these books!\\n\\nThe games themselves were super interesting to read, the setting and the different traps... I think at the time it was very imaginative especially in the sense of the Mutts taking on the images of the other tributes, like it's sick, tiwsted and sadistic but it kind of has to be in the sense that the Games themselves are a sport of death that the people in the Capitol actually enjoy watching. I honestly forgot how brutal some parts are, especially at the very start of it!\\n\\nWhat really stands out for me, is my love of the characters, they're all so different and bring something unique to the story that it's hard not to enjoy. You have such serious characters, the humour in some (mainly Effie), the love, the passion and the never ending hope it just calls to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst up, we of course have THE GIRL ON FIREEEEEEE (insert fire emoji here), anyway, I think Katniss is the definition of strong female protagonist. She steps up and takes her sister place, I think during this re-read I noticed quite a lot more. She's very very hesitant to make friendships/relationships with people HOWEVER the ones she does make are undoubtedly strong. I think her relationship with Rue was so sweet and also heartbreaking at the same time because Rue is her one chance of holding on to something the reminds her of home. I think at times Katniss comes off as quite a \\\"cold\\\" character, but personally I think it's more of a defence mechanism. I really really enjoyed seeing the interaction between her and Peeta and her thought process on them, however confusing they are at the time.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy number one is always, and forever (Just to point out I also have a lot of love for Finnick, but we're only talking about The Hunger Games right now and Peeta and Katniss are my number one ship for this series, I SAID WHAT I SAID). I find Peetas character arc super interesting in the sense that he really really does love Katniss, and I know some people don't like him, may see him in a certain way, but when I re-read things he really did do things with the best intentions. Especially with the Career tributes (also super smart), and when it came to I guess connecting and building on the relationship between himself and Katniss he never once forced Katniss to do anything she didn't want, he was truthful (sometimes played up to help the both of them) and so loving and protective. Peeta is just genuinely a nice person, I have a thing for just nice character in books it can't be helped!\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonally I think is an excellent character, when you see him he's kind of the laughing stock because he fell of the stage in a drunken moment. However there is so much depth to him, and the more you start to learn and realise about him the more I empathise with him. Haymitch has a very very bad addiction to Alcohol because of his times with the Games, not just in them but training countless people up over the years for them all to end up dying in the games.If you really think of having to go through this every year for over twenty years, that's a super hard thing to go through. I think Haymitch is undeniably a smart character, especially in the sense of sending packages to Katniss and the communication between the two, I thought it was very well done.\\n\\n\\n\\nI absolutely LOVE ! I think for a book like this it's enjoyable to see someone like Effie who is just slightly oblivious to certain situations when comparing the treatment of people from the Capitol to those in District 12. One of the moments I loved was when she was training Katniss and her reaction of \\\"Not above the ankle\\\" I just thought it was so funny, they're going into a life and death game and she's more concerned about what's \\\"proper\\\" I think (if I'm correct) you see the difference in Effie between The Hunger Games and Mockingjay.\\n\\n\\n\\nhas my heart, out of everybody that came from the Capitol with all of the extravagance, Cinna is probably the most down to earth person. He just has such a chilled out vibe, and is super soothing in times of need. His friendship with Katniss gave me EVERYTHING, I think he really played his part, he started something, and always tried to protect Katniss.\\n\\nI would say more about other characters, but I feel like I'll just go on forever... I will write something on Gale in my Catching Fire Review, it's just he's not really a prominent person in this book.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat I\\n\\n- Knowing what I know in Catching Fire and Mockingjay there is a of foreshadowing that I would never of noticed, but I think it's done in such a subtle way that you'd never even really think about it. I think things are drilled into you from the start, but when you actually think about things and all of the other things that happen I was just like HOW IS THIS HERE! It was very good!\\n- As mentioned, I really enjoy the humour in this, I think it's all at times where I don't expect it, and because of the matter of the book it's always a good moment to be able to have a chuckle.\\n- Peeta teaching Katniss about the different bread from the other districts, I thought it was a nice little moment and my little heart,\\n- The development of the characters throughout!\\n- The amount of times I got Goosebumps at certain parts, I can't even explain.\\n- The back stories that connect Katniss and Peeta, you have the bread story but my personal favourite is hands down the moment in the cave when Peeta is explaining things to Katniss about when he first noticed her and he just remember so much. It gets me every single time!\\n- The slight defiances towards the capitol\\n- Cinna giving Katniss the Pin, I just love it!\\n\\nWhat I\\n\\n- It's not that I DIDN'T like it it's just a thought... I think it would of been interesting to see things from other peoples POV (I mean if a book came from Peetas POV you bet I'd snap that up, but I'd love to of known more about Foxface and Thresh.\\n\\n\\n\\nOverall I really REALLY enjoyed my re-read of The Hunger Games, it brought me so much happiness, my love for Peeta is on a high once more and I'm so excited to carry on with Catching Fire, probs gunna cry!\\n\\nThe Hunger Games - 5 Stars\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s twenty to one in the morning, and I’m on a Hunger Games high!\\n\\nI really really want to write a full review tomorrow, it will be full of my completely biased love towards this series 😍\"\n",

I wanted to compare... and it is pretty eye opening.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMotivations and all... eerily similar.\\n\\nI still think Katniss is the MC who ... oppressed and forced into violence... pushing back to right the Capitol’s wrongs— no, a TYRANT’S wrongs, where Snow wants CONTROL, to no end. Katniss wants just & fair treatment for her loved ones, in the districts, & in general.\\n\\nBUT will the books to come create more of a dreaded balance in motivation?\\nI don’t quite think so. I have more faith in her than that. 🤔\\nAhhhh! I must be going nuts 😂.\\n\\nThough it is interesting that I even debated her motivation. I believe Katniss will become more true as she gains more knowledge regarding the big picture, though she is definitely fierce, vicious even, when it comes to defending what she thinks is right, and maybe even selfish at times... certainly (because aren’t we all? No one is perfect, & she has a HUGE amount of pressure on her), but with good reason/intention/ motivation.\\nI will keep to myself what made me even ponder this, in thinking about what I could remember of her actions in the next two books of the trilogy, as I do not want to spoil anything.\\n\\nBut yeah; I WAS nuts! 😰 Smh.\\n\\nAfter all that seriousness... here is some light & fluffy:\\n\\nGod, I love this book. I love Katniss. I love Peeta.\\n\\nI’ve always hated Gale, lol. Sorry, not sorry for that one.\\n\\n__________________\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\n\\n()\\n\\nI have read this freaking brilliant novel and the sequels at LEAST 8-10(?) times, & probably 5 of those times were in direct succession (as in reading books 1-3, then back to book #1 to do it all over again, and then again, and then again, aaaaaand then again. All within a span of 2 weeks)!\\nThat should tell you enough ;-).\"\n",

In that time, I decided to watch the movie rather than reading the book. The movie was amazing and I loved it. But a few years later, when this book found its way to me again, I needed to read it and solve the ultimate battle – movie versus books. As it usually happens in my case – the book version won – without any doubts.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games is a story about Katniss Everdeen, a girl from District 12, who lives with her mum and little sister in the poorest district of them all. She hunts in the woods with her friend/crush Gale in order to provide food for her family.\\n\\nSurrounded by all twelve districts, there is the Capitol, the shiny city where all the rich and popular people live. A long time ago, the districts tried to go into war and lost. As part of the surrender, each year the Capitol organises a live TV show, called The Hunger Games. Every year, a boy and a girl from each district are randomly chosen to battle in an arena until the last man standing.\\n\\nWhen Katniss’s little sister is chosen as the girl tribute from district 12, Katniss volunteers to take her place without even thinking. Both her and Peeta (the male tribute) are then headed over to the Capitol and the preparations for the games can begin.\\nIn a world where people like watching children kill each other, it can be pretty upsetting to see this as a reality. I can’t help but think that unfortunately, people have some instinct left in them and are unconsciously enjoying watching other people suffer. Think of the gladiator fights, ultimate fighting matches and other events similar to these.\\n\\nPutting that aside, what I love about this book was the attention to details. From the descriptions of the districts, to the preparations for the games. And the game itself was so well written that I kept turning page after page, desperate to see what will happen next.\\n\\nI love Katniss, her bravery, her love for her little sister, all the sacrifices that she has made. Starting with her volunteering instead of her sister, to her love with Gale. Her spirit to make things right can be felt throughout the whole book. Her rebellion and her stance with all the people that are not treated fairly by the Capitol.\\n\\nEven though presented as a Young-Adult, I am convinced this is a book every adult should read as well, and have a few thoughts about their surroundings. I loved the first book, and I can’t wait to start reading the second book of the series as well.\\n\\n| | | |\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"5 amazing stars!\\n\\n\\n\\nI cannot believe this. I love The Hunger Games. I did not see that coming. Which is why I put off reading this series as much as I could. At one point I was sure I would never read it.\\n\\nBut let me start at the beginning. I saw the movie first. It was advertised as . I was in my Twilight phase, so I found that offensive as there were no vampires in The Hunger Games. Not to mention the shock and the repulsion at the plot (At that point in my life I had no idea what meant. I was all into adult and/or vampire literature.). And I found the actress playing Katniss quite bad. She mostly had only one expression on her face for the entire movie (just as the boy playing Harry Potter). Little did I know that it was something the character wanted, not showing any emotion. And that's why a book is so much better than a movie. You get more information.\\n\\nThen I became active on GR and The Hunger Games was all I saw when comparing books with other people. I resisted reading it for more than a year, then I said I'd give it a try. If I liked it then fine, if I didn't then I'd dnf. But I liked it. Big time.\\n\\n\\n\\nI love both Katniss and Peeta. And I love how for quite a part of the book Katniss is on her own, and it isn't boring. I was there in the wood with her all the way, almost feeling cold at night and smelling the pine trees. I thank Suzanne Collins for that. There aren't many YA authors who can make me forget I'm reading about teenagers. Actually, I'd say this is closer to adult than YA. There isn't any unnecessary teenage angst. These kids understand the graveness and horror of the situation they're in, and they do their best to try and survive. I wish I'd see more of that in YA books.\\n\\nAnd Peeta. In the movie it felt as if he intruded on Katniss and Gale. In the book it's a whole other story. Katniss sees Gale as more of a friend than anything else. She's not secretly in love with the handsome, popular guy. And I think the book-Peeta is better looking than the movie-Peeta. Also, even if he is in love with Katniss, he doesn't seem as desperate as he does in the movie. Truth be told, I saw the movie again yesterday and it felt like seeing it for the first time. All the characters had more depth than the first time.\\n\\nNot to mention that twist at the end with the mutts. That wasn't in the movie, and it was so cruel. What kind of people would do that?\\n\\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I really, really need to continue with the second book. I have a few arcs waiting for me, but I cannot think of anything else.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Battleground\\nThe Hunger Games is quite understandably one of the greatest successes in fantasy fiction over the last decade. Although it probably targeted teen fantasy, it is a very entertaining read for any age. The writing is good and pacy, and the characters and their interactions are developed really well not only over this one book but continue over the trilogy. Gradually we get to see the personality traits of Katniss and Peeta, and how they develop as individuals and towards each other. Katniss is very reserved and her character is defined more by her expertise with a bow and arrow, but gradually we discover she is brave, loyal and much more of a suspicious thinker. Peeta is resourceful with a keen appreciation of alliances, tactics and strategy. Deep down we suspect he has always had an attraction towards Katniss but living in this era, loyalties and friendships need to be proven over and over again.\\n\\nWhat makes the hunger games so good is the concept of the games themselves and the totalitarian political and social structure that underpins them. It's about keeping a subjugated people distracted while being governed frugally and ruthlessly. Sooner or later a people will rise up and challenge the state, but it requires a figurehead and that catalyst moment.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games are therefore more than just a competition or gladiatorial event but will they spark something the organisers didn't expect? The films are great to watch but the books give the opportunity to appreciate the thinking, motivations and feelings in much more detail.\\n\\nA highly recommended trilogy for any age!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"“Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor.”\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games: 5+ stars!\\nCatching Fire: 5 stars\\nMockingjay: 4 stars\\n\\nFirst read: 12 November 2013\\nSecond read: 4 July 2017\\nThird read: 6 January 2019\\nFourth read: 13 February 2020\\n\\n\\nThis is a book that brings me out of balance every time I read it. A book that takes me completely from this world. A book that I want to read again as soon as I finish it. A book that makes me feel dazed and shocked for days. Nothing I have read in all of my life has topped this book. This book is phenomenal, a master piece, I cannot praise this enough.\\n\\n\\nSo I read this book first when the movie came out, in Dutch, and it has always been one of my favorite books ever. This is actually one of the first books I’ve ever read for fun in my life and I’m so excited that I can talk about it in a review for the first time. After reading this I realized again why it is my favorite book again, and it’s only flaw is that I wanted more. From everything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the main reasons for reading this book again, besides it being my favorite and wanting to re-experience it again, was because I have wanted the beautiful hardbacks for years now, and I was finally able to get my hands on them. They are absolutely gorgeous and I love the design so much. I’m so in love with the mockingjay on the front of the naked hardcovers and I just love the designs inside the book that matches the contents of this book really well.\\n\\n\\nFrom the first word in this book I was just sucked in the world again. The writing style was amazing, Katniss was amazing, the world building. I was so happy to be back reading this plot again.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo since it is technically the first time I read Suzanne Collin’s words, without being translated, I can judge that fairly. The writing style in this book was perfect, it had the right amount of anything. The right amount of world building, of humor, of character building, of descriptions, of main character thinking, of tension, of combat, of pacing etc… It made me laugh, it made me cry, it was just prefect! She can tell so much on one page, and write action so well and clear. I also want to comment how much I loved being in Katniss her head, it felt like a story she was telling me personally. Even after knowing what the next page would contain, I still couldn’t stop reading.\\n\\nI do have one tiny remark though (but it wasn’t really necessary because maybe it would have made the book longwinded), that I as a diehard fan of this trilogy would have appreciated. That was more information about the other candidates and districts. I mean we only get to hear like 6 challenge scores, we only know 10 names, we only get 5 outfit descriptions here and there out of the 24 contestants so that was a missed opportunity I thought to make it more personal and rememberable.\\n\\n\\nI completely forgot how great this world building is. How much history is put in this book to back up all the current cruelty. I absolutely love the design of the hunger games and the capitol with the surrounding districts and all the other details. I also loved the addition of the muttants, they were so cleaver thought through and I was so impressed about the vivid writing of them. I’m still haunted by the wold/bear like creatures with the tributes eyes and I loved the mocking jays and their singing talents but also the trackerjackers. And who in their right mind can make me fall in love with a book about child murder.. Just the way the words are written about the world suggests that the writer thinks this is not okay and that was one of the things I love most about this book and that really made me laugh.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKatniss is and will always be one of my favorite character. She is a bit cynical, but also super badass. She makes right decisions always knows what to do, keeps her head clear, protects who she loves. I’m still so impressed with how flawed Collins can make a character and also made me love her from the first sentence. I love how much Katniss doubts about her and Peeta in this book though the reader can see it is genuine. I also loved in this book that the girl is the protector and the provider and she is in no way dependent on Peeta.\\n\\n\\nLike I said before I would have liked to know more about the other tributes. But this is only because I seriously love all the others. Every character whether they were a villain or a hero was perfect in character. I’m so obsessed with the career tributes; how can a person be willing to risk their life like this willingly. I’m so curious about the situations in district 1 through 6 (I don’t believe we get to hear anything from them in the next books). I absolutely love how the careers are this evil villains that train their whole life. I’m so in love with Rue and Prim they are both adorable, I found the bond that Katniss forms with the girls really realistic. I also found Haymitch and Effy super realistic. They are both in their own way super unique personalities I’ve never come across in a book. I love that they both deal with their feelings in their own way and I also really like the character development the both of them make. I also really like the characters from the capitol. I think the people are put down so haughtily and naive that you kind of feel sorry for them even though they are one of the reasons the hunger games still continues. And of course Cinna, what a hero, one of my favorite characters in this book. Peeta is just amazing, I loved how supportive he is of Katniss.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike so many, I’m not a fan of love triangles. And I skipped over most off the parts where Katniss compares Gale and Peeta, although I must admit this aren’t much. I loved to slowly experience Katniss fall in love with Peeta, even when she’s not realizing it. And that is one of the things I love most about this book, the realistically falling in love.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis plot, it never stops, never halts, never slows and certainly never bores. Every single aspect about this book is so thought through and cleverly designed that there just isn’t a flaw to detect. I loved the political aspect that’s woven in this series, the tactics that behind picking a ‘simple’ dress was so awesome to read. I loved the involvement of clothing in this book so much, it adds so much more dimension and reality and shows the differences between districts and capitol so well. I loved to read about what Cinna designs and creates and found it so clever of Collins to also add these dimensions (only thing again was that I missed some more costume descriptions of all the other tributes). I enjoyed this plot so so much and I realized that I had forgotten some details that aren’t in the movie. The thing about the muttations their eyes, gave me goosbumps all over again. And also the story line from the Avox girl! I also LOVE the including of some really original aspects that are going to be associated with the Hunger Games forever. Like the three fingers in the air kiss and the mockingjay symbol.\\nThe only thing that was kind of a shame, and that is done pretty good in the movie, is to enlighten the motives of the capitol and game makers a bit more. The decisions behind some things are a bit vague and in the movie it shows really clear what happens everywhere in the arena and capitol. I for example have no clue how Thresh died and I wanted so much more to know about the bloody opening battle and I found it a missed opportunity to not include this.\\nSome favorite scenes:\\n- Katniss volunteering (still tearing up with this)\\n\\n- Katniss her dress\\n\\n- Katniss scoring her 11\\n\\n- The interviews\\n\\n- The opening from the hunger games\\n\\n- Rue O Rue:(\\n\\n- Katniss finding Peeta near the water\\n- Katniss dropping the nest on the carreers\\n\\n- Being chased by the wolf/bear like muttants\\n- The final scene with the berries\\n\\n\\n\\nThis ending has so much tension and though it concludes this book it urges you to keep on reading. The way Katniss plays the capitol is absolutely amazing and I love how she outsmarted them. I also really like that the last interview got included in this one and that Peeta’s leg shows that not everything can be healed.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"When it comes to The Hunger Games, you will hardly find anybody who has never heard of this book. I knew what it was about pretty much since its publication, but always avoided to read it because of the ridiculous hype it received. Suzanne Collins has influenced an entire genre with her trilogy, inspiring popular series like Divergent or Legend, which can be considered an achievement to be admired for. The opinion that this series is way over-hyped still hasn't left my mind, but by now, I can finally see this book is so beloved by readers all over the world. Easy to get into, easy to read, not too complex, yet fast-paced and cleverly plotted with characters you can easily get attached to - that's what defines , in my opinion. Some of its qualities can be considered negative in a literary context, but for me it also became a book which it was impossible to take down after a certain amount of pages, and even inspite of its clearly present flaws, Suzanne Collins managed to create an engaging adventure story in a dystopian setting.\\n\\nThe adventure aspect in this book was the most intriguing. I didn't know about most of the plot points before reading it, so the book continued to surprise me with every chapter. Fast-paced as it was, boredom never managed to overtake the excitement of learning what was to come next, as well as the interior urge to learn what happened in the past to divide the districts in such a way. Unfortunately, a historical background to previous events in the novel's timeline which lead to the way Panem is structured in this story was the last thing Suzanne Collins thought about to give her readers, but I still don't lose hope that we get a more insightful exploration of this topic in the following sequels. Also, it's difficult to believe the explanation for the introduction of the Hunger Games as a method to keep citizens from organizing another uprising against the powerful government. Some plot points felt forced, as if Collins needed to take the plot in a certain direction and sacrificed her characters for the sake of the plot, but ultimately, she managed to create a balanced story with both engaging plotlines and interesting characters.\\n\\nThe novel cannot be praised for its originality; in fact, a lot of people have already pointed out before how similar it is to the earlier published Japanese , but reading it for what it is, that fact doesn't take the excitement away from the novel. I practically inhaled the last 200 pages in the course of a few hours, always wanting to know what was to happen next, and the portrayal of Katniss Everdeen as the female protagonist helped a lot with this: Katniss is strong, cunning, she doesn't mind what others think of her, and she doesn't hesitate to use certain events to her own benefit, even if it means manipulating others. A lot of other authors have since then tried to come up with more characters like Katniss, but most of them feel like bad copies (yes, I am totally referring to Divergent's Tris). In addition, the reality television aspect was an outstanding part of the novel which I particularly enjoyed. It seemed like a very believable and realistic addition to the story.\\n\\nUltimately, even if there are things you can criticize about , those aspects never became strong enough to disrupt my enjoyment of the excitement that was this book. I am definitely going to read the sequel, even though I'll wait some time in order to escape my usual antipathy against second books in a series. I don't exactly regret never having read it earlier, but it is also a good feeling to have read it and to finally know the reasons for the hype it received.\"\n",

She lives in the poorest district (well it's the poorest since the disappearance of district 13), which is number 12... I found myself choked within the first few pages, saddened at the life she was living and the love she has for her younger sister... and it's her sister that forces Katniss to step forward for the annual Hunger Games...\\n\\nKatniss and Peeta, the young baker boy who is from District 12 too, go through a few weeks of pure hell but take us on a journey that both gives us laughter, warmth and plenty of tears.

      "      \"review\": \"Everyone's reviewed The Hunger Games. It's time someone reviewed the setting, specifically, mine.*\\n\\nI take the book and head to my bed, attempting to worm my way in between the edge and my dog, who is grumpy and doesn't want to be disturbed. I'm left with about eighteen inches of blanket between him and the edge of the covers, so I draw a throw over the exposed parts and start reading. I soon find myself lost in imagining the hardscrabble life of District 12 and wondering if the 'meat-eaters' Katniss refers to outside the fence mean zombies. I hope so, but I'm doubtful, because otherwise the reviews would have mentioned zombies. Most reviewers don't just forget to mention something like that in a review if the book has them. Like vampires, they are hard to ignore. So she probably means cougars and such. Oh well. Still, note to self: look out for 'meat eaters.'\\n\\nKatniss' has just the sort of self-reliance and composure I love to see in a character. I understand her anger at her mother, although I sigh a little at yet another female who has an Oedipus complex. I am glad that Prim is used to humanize her, even if it is a tried and true technique. I find myself interested in Buttercup, the antagonistic, ill-named cat. Still, my own canine Buttercup isn't budging, despite my attempts to gradually use my leg as a wedge to drive him further toward the middle of the bed. I'm getting colder, since the throw isn't compensating for the house cooling. Since it is late and I'm cold, I decide a hot bath would be just the setting for the next stage of the journey.\\n\\nAlas, while the water is satisfactorily warm to start with, it never reaches the truly steaming temperature that is worth a prolonged soak. I try to read quickly. Leaving the District, headed toward the Capitol, and the wider world in this post-apocalypic setting is becoming clear, as well as Collins starting to detail revolutionary underpinnings. Still, it's subtle, and I rather like that in a book, especially a teen one. The city setting is unsurprising, although it seems like quite a tech contrast from the districts, and the connection Katniss develops with the understated stylist Cinna is warming. I wonder if he is supposed to be referencing a real-world designer? Except all the ones I've heard of seem quite flamboyant. I wonder if Collins is trying to say something about character in the city? It is here, immersed in rapidly cooling water that I wonder a bit if I'm reading too fast, because I find myself hitting more areas that I don't think Collins explained and I find it a little odd when Katniss suddenly drops these bits of knowledge for the reader. Except why does she seem clueless at times? But despite running more water, the bathwater isn't getting much warmer, so I can't be bothered to go back and re-read to see if I missed some subtle hint. I'm a little irritated from being chilled, so it's time to get out before I start picking further at the story.\\n\\nChanged into pajamas, dogs sprawled on the bed but with a spare third left for me. I weasel my way under the covers and nudge a dog aside. The contestants have entered the arena, poised in their metal circles. The writing is done well enough to give a sense of place and yet pull action forward. The firewall unleashed by the gamemasters seems a bit unfair and reminds me of (insert any reality show here) but it reminds me I have a heating pad in the bed, so I turn it on to warm me up faster. The action in the arena is captivating, and is isn't until Katniss is hallucinating that I realize I am also experiencing a bit of double-vision. My new bookshelf arrived yesterday, and it didn't get more than a day to air out before I impatiently hauled it inside, spending a number of happy hours rearranging my books. Unfortunately, it had been so tightly wrapped that the stain hadn't really finished out-gassing, and I was starting to get headachey. As Katniss tried to recover, I decided timing was right for my own move. Besides, I knew she would survive--it's a trilogy. I turned on the ceiling fan and headed to the living room where there was a nice thick comforter and couch just waiting for me.\\n\\nWrapped up in the comforter, I prepared to finish the book. I liked the way Collins gradually brought about Katniss' political awakening. Using Rue was a particularly smart move that helped it feel organic with character and story. No zombies--I don't think, although that appears to be a question for another time. I certainly understand complaints about the nature of the games and how Collins wrote herself a number of easy ways out of a truly ethically ambiguous situation, and I confess that goes against my story preference. I find myself agreeing with emphasis on the story as a fairy tale. Still, in that context, it was enjoyable and well-paced, if not riveting.\\n\\nAnd, after all, I was finally warm, snug in the feather comforter with only hands and head exposed.\\n\\nThree and a half warm stars.\\n\\nCross posted at\\n\\n*Edit thoughtfully provide by .\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"on the one hand, the hunger games fits my idea of what 'story' meant back when i was a kid, transporting me to #6 school library c. 1986, where mrs. greene would read aloud and i'd go all outerbody, floating off into 'lost in a book' world. over the two days i read this thing, i had that slight bookbuzz between reading sessions (better than any booze or drug i know) and 'fess up to sneaking pages in at any and all available intervals (at the coffeemachine, on the shitter, walking the hound, etc)...\\n\\non the other hand, i found it a book of incredible wasted opportunities.\\nmy problems?\\nhere are a few:\\n\\nafter such a bold move as taking her sister's place in the hunger games, katniss doesn't really have all that much to do. she dodges a few magic bullets (i'll get into that later), and makes out with a baker's son, but she never really has to do anything she doesn't want to do (or, perhaps, anything that could potentially damage her standing (read: sales) with the book's core bookbuying demographic) -- this thing never lives up to the expectations collins herself has set, and katniss rarely has a moment of introspection or reaction.\\n\\n(is a spoiler alert necessary? has anyone already read this book?)\\n\\nwho does katniss kill?\\n\\n1) a boy who just murdered 12 yr old rue.\\n2) cato, while he's being slowly tortured to death.\\n\\nthe first is easy. wildly justified and never given a second thought. (could collins have spared a single page to either a nice existenzy moment in which katniss became acutely aware that she took away 'all he has... all he's ever gonna have.' or, at least, a kind of natural revulsion at the sheer physicality of plunging a knife through flesh and bone?) and the second is a mercy killing, an act of kindness and bravery. why create this 'battle royale' scenario only to breeze over the most challenging part? it seemed a deliberate attempt to keep things a bit surfacey and transfer all the 'deep' stuff onto a somewhat manufactured love triangle.\\n\\nand as for those magic bullets.\\ni suppose it's possible to run blindfolded across a busy five-lane highway and avoid getting clipped, but... it's very unlikely. and dramatically, it's stupid. it's comedy. it's . if you're gonna toss katniss into this world, milk it. goose your reader. push it to the brink, lady. you took the easy way out on the 'big' issues, why take the easy way out with your set pieces?\\n\\nlemme examine a single scene to make my point -- the penultimate action scene in which katniss rushes out into the opening to get the medicine. here's what happens:\\n\\n\\n1. a knife whisks through the air and slices her forehead. now, katniss didn't see it coming, didn't dodge in the nick of time... it just happened to fly by so as to conveniently bloody up her forehead, but without instantly transforming her into a drooling vegetable. seriously lucky. down to the microsecond & micromeasurement lucky. but let's move on.\\n\\nseconds later:\\n\\n2. katniss is pounced by some girl who holds her down and traces a knife over her lips. about to plunge the knife in, at the very last millisecond... she's thrown off! ok, another 'down to the micromeasurement' save in the same scene.\\n\\nand seconds later:\\n\\n3. the guy who pulled the girl off is about to kill katniss, but, again - at the last second! - when he learns she was good to rue, he lets her go. what?!?! really?!?! this late in the game? knowing it's kill or be killed? he lets her go? b/c she was sweet to a girl that he would've had to kill, anyway?\\n\\n\\nsorry. maybe any of these elements on their own would be fine, but three of 'em in a single scene? (a knife that is microseconds from its mark followed by a killer who is microseconds from her mark followed by a killer who has a 'at the last microsecond' change of heart)... when nearly every set piece plays out like this, i gotta say one thing to miss collins: diminishing returns! diminishing fucking returns!\\n\\nand puh-leeze don't take refuge in the argument that it's a YA book. now, look. with YA there are wider parameters (you can, for example, be a bit more derivative in that your audience is reading this shit for the first time), but why soften your edges? why create great Hitchcockian scenes of suspense and breadcrumbs only to have them lead up to Bayesque (michael, that is) setpieces of luck, chance, magic bullets, and serious muddafuckin' boooshit?! and why downplay the psychological and/or moral effects of murder? i don't get it.\\n\\ncollins seemed almost to have a checklist in terms of catchy story elements and ways to catch hold of the zeitgeist. which is not a disparagement. she's a great storyteller with a knack for making said story applicable to the contemporary human dilemma (society of the spectacle, fascism vs. liberty, etc) -- and, it's terrific that kids are reading books about a tough, no-nonsense chick who has a kind of political awakening...\\nbut collins, in this first volume, was kinda lazy.\\nwhich is a shame b/c she made something pretty special.\"\n",

That delightfully precocious pixie of a full-grown girl who may not be the beauty of the world, but whose offbeat charm has vaulted her into the goddess stratosphere is missing and that's a crying shame.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\"Pretty\\\" is always nice, but give me the goofy girl every time!\\n\\n\\nOkay, let's move on from that barely-serious diatribe...\\n\\n\\nAll the hoopla surrounding had me expecting a reading experience so enthralling that it would whip my nipples off. Well, I've still got me nips. So, was this exciting at all? Yes. As exciting as the build up made it out to be? No, of course not. Is it ever? By now I should know better than to get too excited about reading a book said to be -good.\\n\\nHowever, relative to other books, had maybe a few more moments that kept me chained to it and reading on when I might have stopped, but in no way did I get irretrievably wrapped up in it. And that's probably because the story of a young girl fighting for her life and falling in love wasn't written with me in mind. Its appeal is not intended for a middle-aged grump.\\n\\nThis is a YA novel. I had to keep reminding myself of that and excuse its immature voice and some of the writing...although describing inanimate objects as being \\\"heartless\\\" gave me a chuckle, while the somewhat common use of adverb shortcuts couldn't help but annoy. I can see why has become popular with teens. It's a coming of age tale in which the revelation that the real world and the people in it are not always black and white, good and evil, dawns upon the main character as it eventually does for teens.\\n\\nWord of warning. I listened to the audiobook version of this as narrated by veteran television actress Carolyn McCormick. You may have seen her on Law and Order or One Life To Live. If you ever come across a book narrated by her, avoid it like the muthafncking plague! McCormick laid on the melodrama thick, stressing the last word in what seemed like every sentence. Go back to the start of this paragraph and lay on a heavy dose of languishing drama and epic intensity to the last word in each sentence and you can see how hit or miss the technique (if you can call that technique) works and how utterly annoying it is. It made me shout \\\"Your speech pattern sucks!\\\" for the first time in my life. Not to beat down on the woman, but she also has a baby-talk lisp that comes out when she pronounces \\\"s\\\", \\\"th\\\" and \\\"oo\\\" sounds. Listening to her pronounce \\\"juice\\\" is pretty funny. Listening to her for nine hours is not.\\n\\nI made sure to separate my negative feelings over the audiobook narration from my feelings on the book itself and my 3-star rating reflects that.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Neither a big sci-fi nor a young adult literature reader, I found myself immediately drawn into the post-apocalyptic world created by Collins in The Hunger Games. It was easy to read and certainly created a futuristic world, however, there were times I could clearly identify issues which face us today (reality TV-- is it real or staged?, the haves vs. the have nots, etc.).\\n\\nIn discussing the story with others who have read this book, one thing cannot be denied. Despite the hardships and challenges that Katniss and her competitors face during the Hunger Games, Katniss never really has to make any difficult choices... to say more would spoil the book. Her \\\"strong\\\" character could have benefited by a \\\"lesser of two evils\\\" scenario-- but that never happens. Overall, it was a good read (creepy at times for sure) and I look forward to the next installment in the series.\\n\\nOne editorial note--In many cases, novels can often be pared down to the betterment of their stories, however, in this book I found myself wanting to know more about how the districts and the Capitol government, which was obviously formed after the destruction of the U.S. as we know it. I would have gladly read another 100-150 pages to learn more about District 12 and its sister districts. I hope Collins brings readers up to speed on this particular government's creation.\\n\\n(Reviewed 12/6/09)\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I like these books. The third was my favorite.\\n\\nThat's my review of the book. What I'm really here to talk about is the movie, and this is going to have spoilers like you wouldn't believe. Just warning you.\\n\\nWe just returned from watching the Hunger Games movie, and the experience was deeply disturbing. It should be disturbing, of course: we watched a movie about teenagers being forced to kill one another for the entertainment of a wealthy, lucky few. So, it's not disturbing that the movie itself was disturbing.\\n\\nWhat was REALLY disturbing, though, was the audience. As one teenager beat another one to death--a large male beating a small female--the audience burst into cheers because the girl was essentially a badguy. The girl was, at most, 13 or 14. The actress looked the appropriate age. The cheering didn't even stop when her small body was dropped into the grass and the camera focused in on her lifeless face.\\n\\nWe're sitting in a huge theater, watching a film where 24 children are required to fight to the death against one another. There is a mild amount of romance mixed in with all of the carnage, and the kiss between Peeta and Katniss was enough to get a large part of the audience whistling and squeeling with delight.\\n\\nIt was like they were watching an entirely different movie from the one Joy and I were watching.\\n\\nI remember reading some reviews of the book pointing out how many reviews focused entirely on the half-assed romance story, ENTIRELY MISSING THE POINT OF THE SERIES. It wasn't until seeing the audience reaction to the film that this really sunk in. Are these people entirely oblivious that THEY are the audience to the Hunger Games? Do they really not recognize the Capital is a slightly exaggerated version of us wealthy first-worlders? Granted, we don't take two tributes from each district. We tend to attack people outright, police their countries, and then replace their political structures with something more to our liking. But, a rose by any other name smells just as sweet.\\n\\nThe book attempted to challenge our expectations, and the movie tried to as well. The violence constantly felt WRONG. Each death gave me the same queasy, emotional feeling I get when I watch . Instead of casting the teenagers with a bunch of attractive twenty-somethings, they actually chose children, most of whom did not look ready for combat. They made a point of showing you children who were dead, but not giving you the twisted satisfaction of drawn-out and exciting fight scenes. This movie had much more brutality than action. And the scene with Cato breaking down at the end was almost perfect, although his death was more drawn out and difficult to stomach in the book.\\n\\nBut it doesn't matter what Suzanne Collins writes, or what the director directs, if the audience is oblivious to anything challenging their world views. I suppose if you're looking hard enough for an 'action' movie, you can find one in And if you only care about which boy Katniss ends up with in the end, you might totally miss the fact that YOU'RE THE FUCKING CAPITAL, and BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO THE CAPITAL.\\n\\nWe've decided to just rent the movies from here on out, because they're troubling enough without having to deal with the audience as well.\"\n",

I love those moments when I had nothing to do but reading this book all day. Suzanne Collins made her books phenomenal by creating a solid and attractive world where people are ruled by a dictator, Snow. Katniss Everdeen is an ordinary girl, but her life is changed forever after she volunteers to participate in the game that your life is just a stake for other people. That's so cruel, and it's a political matter intensifying this book to the highest level.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat I considered this one a meaningful read was the fact that I was pulled into this book from the start. The vibes were depressing. The characters were plain but real, they're all the same as us, the delicate beings. Collins delivered us this concept very well that I totally understood the gist of the book.\\n\\nIt's never been so true that, in my opinion, THG is always my standard when I read other books that have the setting like this one. Why ? Because Collins successfully convinced me to believe that her book had a classic idea and influenced many dystopian novels these days. And look at that those books where their setting are post-apocalyptic worlds and people had to live in dystopain societies, still none of them are better than THG.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI do want to say many things about THG but don't know where to start them. I think the movie just shows what I want to say. The meaning of being humans being easily changed by the environment you live. Some small things can lead to very big things and cause some serious damage to a whole system.\\n\\nI'll come back when I have something to add into this review.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5 stars for my all time favorite dystopian novel.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"5 ★★★★★ hungering for M.O.R.E\\n\\nThis is at least my 3rd read and I think I came to love it even more, now that I have read a couple more dystopian books and really can appreciate and fully recognize how skilled Suzanne is. Her way of building the world and gradually feeding the reader bits and pieces of information makes this read so thrilling. I expected to love this audiobook, but I actually all over again as I was simply blown away. I cherish both the fantastic aspect of the story and the cruel reality of the Hunger Games. There's also this really cute and surprisingly sassy guy called Peeta, that totally stole my heart like he did when I read it almost a decade ago. I mean, come the fuck . Just at him:\\n\\nI thoroughly disagree with this:\\n\\nBecause Peata ain't a snack or even a meal, he is a 7 course dinner. I don't care what y'all are saying, I love him. Bye, haters. #teampeeta\\n\\nyou enjoy gripping dystopian reads with a strong female lead and the brutal edge only the fight of survival can offer. You will need to hold a balancing act between cheering characters on to survive and cheering them on to kill other kids.\\n\\n\\nKatniss is the main bread giver to her family. Ever since her father died, she hunts to ensure her family's survival. And surviving sure is hard in District 12, one of 12 - formerly 13 - districts in Panem, a country ruled by the capitol that is inhabited by colourful and preppy people that live ignorance and cruelty in a way, that makes it unbelievably brutal.\\n\\nEach year for a quarter of a century, they have been the audition to the this world has ever seen - The Hunger Games. And they lavish every second of it, make bets on the strongest contestants and act like they are actually super compassionate pals, while the rest of Panem is forced to watch - citizens - most of which live and work under slave-like conditions characterised by poverty, sickness and famine - hunt and slaughter each other on television. Because they are to forget what it means to rebel against the Capitol.\\n\\nIt is this horror-scenario that Katniss carries on her shoulders while she is preparing for the day of the reaping together with her family. She knows: . The people that are eligible for the Hunger Games are kids and teenagers only, and there are too many lots with the name Katniss Everdeen written on them in the glass bowl that decides over life and death. Too many of them for her to hope she won't hear her name this year. Or that of her best friend Gale.\\n\\nAs stories like these go, she does indeed end up as the and her male is no other than It is safe to say that there will be some internal conflicts throughout this entire book. And so they take off to the Capital. Katniss, the huntress, who knows exactly how to survive, and Peeta, the baker, who has his very own agenda.\\n\\n\\nMentored by a drunkard and an excentric flamingo, they have a week to prepare as best as can for the arena, a place that could hold any danger. Because the other tributes are not the only thing the Capital uses in the Hunger Games. Turns out, Katniss is excellent in hunting game, but not well prepared for the games that lie ahead. Because this is not only . While Peeta seems to be her ally at first, he suddenly requests separate training and bonds with the enemy the second the arena is open for combat.\\n\\nAs the fights continue, Katniss has to , both her own and those of the other tributes, always checking her back, front, sides, up and down. Although the odds don't look good at first, it turns out her hard life offers her an advantage not many other tributes have: Knowing nature.\\n\\nAbout 50% through, I couldn't help but get this tingly feeling I already had the first time read this book; [Insert Mockingjay-tune here]\\n\\n\\n_____________________\\n\\n= 5*\\n\\n= 5*\\n\\n= 5*\\n\\n= 4* (This time I clearly noticed how I would have loved for at least nother Tribute with a very distinct character that also earnes more \\\"on page\\\"-time)\\n\\n= 5*\\n\\n= 5*\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Now, this is a bit worrying.\\n\\nThere are a few young adult fiction bestsellers that I have managed to ignore despite my highly exposed profession. I always knew they would catch up with me at some point, but somehow, I figured Harry would come and get me before Katniss did.\\n\\nFor professional reasons, however, The Hunger Games will now enter my repertoire. And let me just say that the prejudices I carry with me into this reading adventure are a heavy load! Really heavy! BMI over 30, obese kind of prejudice.\\n\\nThe fact that I liked the first page hasn't changed that. So here we go. Who would have thought? I am reading The Hunger Games. It can't be worse than my imagination of it.\\n\\nLet the show begin.\\n\\nPART ONE:\\n\\nWell, the Games themselves are as vulgar as I thought. Roman Gladiator games for postapocalyptic American television addicts, featuring adolescents in the arena. Not impressed, I would like to say. But... despite myself, I like the characters. I like Katniss and Gale and Cinna and Peeta. And Haymitch. And I like to hate Effie as well. It is set up as a likeable Star Wars triangle between Princess Leia, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker, surrounded by freaks of one kind or the other. I can see why it appeals to my students.\\n\\nBut then of course, the Games have not begun yet. Am I going to be able to survive the killing? I will sleep on it.\\n\\nPART TWO:\\n\\nI slept better than Katniss did, for sure, and my work day wasn't half as bad as hers. The Games are like a round of with a dystopian twist. Parents and guardians are not absent. They are the invisible television audience for the children's survival of the most brutal, the cleverest, fittest or luckiest. Whatever it will be.\\n\\nA game changer midway through makes the romantic reader (not me) hope for Romeo and Juliet to be able to survive together without killing each other or themselves. Except that they are not really star-crossed lovers, are they? It is all a show. And this is the frustrating part of the book so far: the bluntness and vulgar showiness of it all. Yes, it has all the elements of dystopia, including the euphemisms, the social injustice, the rebellious youth, the guerilla warfare. But it indulges in the exhibitionism of the society it criticises too much to be convincing. And while Katniss makes a good \\\"school stage\\\" Robin Hood, she is too flat to be a legendary hero.\\n\\nBut never mind. I like her well enough. Another night in the trees ahead.\\n\\nPART THREE:\\n\\nThis is where the disappointment kicks in. Really? And it is not only caused by the funny reaction I received from two of my kids, who happened to come into the room while I was reading (on two different occasions). Both of them raised their eyebrow (wonder where they got that from?) and asked with exactly the same level of sarcasm in their voices: \\\"YOU are reading Hunger Games? Well, THAT is interesting!\\\"\\n\\nThe disappointment was mostly due to the outrageously predictable action. The third part wasn't necessary. All was already said and done, and what remained was just a gladiator show for the audience (fictional in the story and actual in the reading chair), as well as tension buildup for the sequel. PANEM ET CIRCENSES - can it get a more literal representation than in the Hunger Games, set in ... duh ... Panem? And yes, except for killing each other in the circus for television audiences, the only thing they do, nonstop, is eating and talking about food.\\n\\nI am not sure I need to read part two and three. There will be a rebellion against the Capitol, I assume, and Katniss will be torn between her two lovers. She will face the same challenge over and over: how far will she let others rule over her spirit, and where can she afford to be herself, whoever that is? All of that has to be figured out in the outlandishly cruel dictatorship that she calls home.\\n\\nI will give Suzanne Collins all due credit for writing a good young adult novel that captivates adolescents and makes them read. Great work! As for me, I will go back to my comfort zone and continue on my Günter Grass.\\n\\nTO BE CONTINUED? Not now at least ...\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"“May the odds be ever in your favor!”\\n\\nIn the ruins of what was once North America, the cruel and tyrannic empire of Panem is preparing for the 74th annual Hunger Games, gladiatorial fights where youths from all twelve outlying districts are forced into killing each other in an arena, as punishment for a forgotten rebellion.\\n\\nThere is something strangely compelling about the tale of Katniss Everdeen, a poor girl from the poorest of the twelve district, and her journey to the Capitol as a tribute for the Hunger Games. After volunteering for the games to save her younger sister, she embarks on a journey that will take her through the constant fear of death and the fiery passion of love both wrapped around each other. This is one of the most famous tales of our time, and to some extent there is a reason for it.\\n\\nBut I have a confession to make here. Sometimes, you have to go against your most established principles even though you would prefer to stick with them. I have been thinking about this since I was in the middle of reading , and I am still not sure about it, but I am going to say it anyway: the movie was better than the book.\\n\\nStill, I cannot escape the notion that this opinion was caused by the terrible decision to watch the movie without having read the book first. This is something I would only have done if I had no intentions of reading the book at all, and to be honest, that was the case here. I had written off this series completely, and I did not think I would ever end up reading it. So when I came home late from work one night and noticed that the movie would be shown on TV in 30 minutes, I thought \\\"Why not watch it? It's not like I'll ever read the book.\\\" So I ended up watching the whole thing, enjoyed it a lot more than I had expected, and after that experience decided to give the books a chance after all.\\n\\nThis is definitely a plot-driven novel, and that made it a rather disappointing experience to read while knowing practically everything about the plot. Plot-wise, there are very few differences between the book and the movie, those few being relatively unimportant scenes from the book which have been cut in the movie.\\n\\nThe other aspects of the book are not particularly impressive. The writing is mediocre, with a present tense first person narrative which was not good at all. The characters are interesting enough, but suffers from comparison with the brilliant acting in the movie, where in my opinion the characters were actually heavily improved. Because of all this, I get the feeling that the book relies on the plot as its only major strength, and that the same plot is amazing enough to take the reader's attention away from the book's flaws.\\n\\nThe only reason why I am giving this three stars is because it seems unfair to rate it based on a comparison with the movie adaptation, while praising that movie to the skies (I would probably give it five stars). Suzanne Collins has done a brilliant job of creating a captivating tale in a really interesting dystopian setting. So I will stick with this rating even though I am a bit disappointed, and instead expect more from the next couple of books.\\n\\nThat said, I also feel the need to state that I did enjoy the book too. It is an astonishing novel which has put its mark on fictional literature, and I do not regret having read it. It also raises a lot of questions that I would really like to find the answers to, and I can only hope that Collins has managed to complete that task in the sequels.\\n\\nIf you are one of the 17 people who have not yet read this book, I would definitely recommend it, but I would also urge you to read it before watching the movie. If you have already watched the movie, skip it.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"okay so i reread the hunger games for the first time in like… 8 years or something and boyyyyyy it was a ride:\\n\\n* this book came out in like 2008, but goddamn it’s still relevant as fuck\\n\\n* i absolutely adore the fact that it wasn’t a traditional “rise against the government” story, where the girl was The One and she did All The Things - Katniss was thrown into all this shit somehow under the radar, with adults still running the rebellion, but choosing her as a symbol and honestly she’s like “i have no idea what the fuck to do, but i’ll listen to Haymitch and Cinna - adults who know more stuff than I do, and hopefully not get killed”\\n\\n* i also liked the fact that her and Peeta’s traditional roles were reversed: she was the hunter, he was the baker (who was doing the FROSTING on cakes int he bakery, like, i stan) and this was Suzanne Collins saying fuck you to expectations about what roles men and women are supposed to fulfil\\n\\n* this book is disguised as another YA bullshit, but my dudes, holy fuck no - even if you take out the whole “we’ll send your kids to murder each other in an arena for our entertainment” - it deals with a shit ton of issues: PTSD, abandonment, alcoholism, children way too young being forced to take the roles of providers in their respective families, how entertainment affects the way we see the world, how media manipulates perception - like, this shit is Deep™\\n\\n* it annoys me that at one point, this book/series was reduced to Team Gale vs Team Peeta, when… it was honestly about SO much more. And tbh, the progression of the love triangle was natural - when you share a life and death situation with someone, it’s completely natural to have at least some conflicting feelings towards that person, so Katniss’ indecision over Peeta and Gale is completely fucking normal for an adult, let alone a teenager just discovering themselves and exploring their heart\\n\\n* the writing is Really Good, even compared to newer books that I’ve personally read and adored - it’s intense, fast paced, I flew through this in a couple of days and even knowing the story, it was still gripping and adrenaline-fuelled\\n\\n* Peeta is completely underrated as a strategist - like, that kid is Smart™ as fuck\\n\\n* Katniss IS unlikable, but I think that adds to her character, in the idea that you don’t have this delicate girl that Leads A Rebellion with how Special she is - on the contrary, you have a female character that is very human.\\n\\n* She judges her mother for essentially abandoning her and Prim, accepts her back when she “snaps out of it” for lack of a better expression, but she doesn’t really forget. At the same time, she loves her sister fiercely. She’s determinate, but headstrong at times. She’s conniving and ambitious, but when she drops her guard, she’s very loyal to the people close to her. She’s resourceful, smart, but still ruthless at times. I think Collins managed to portray a very real, very human character and that’s something that should be commended.\\n\\n* Katniss and Rue’s relationship was such a punch in the gut, because it really solidifies the idea that these are kids, paying the price for something they had no hand in, paying the price for a past they had no choice in and no control over, and I’m unashamed to say that I, a woman in her 30s, still cried ugly tears when Katniss sang her song for Rue\\n\\n* honestly, my dudes, just… pick up this book and read it, because it’s so, so much more than what the movies reduced it to (I love the movies, but… yeah) - this shit is a dystopian masterpiece and Suzanne Collins is a queen, we stan\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"For three years now, I desperately wanted to reread this series ... it's been so long since I last read it that I was sure that the movies had totally usurped my memory of it. And since I'm currently in the process of unhauling all the books that no longer have a special place in my heart, I needed to see how The Hunger Games series would hold up ... after finishing the first book, I am still undecided (lmao) ... I mean, it was good but I really expected to be way more nostalgic, and for this book to hit me right in the feels ... which din't quite happen.\\n\\nAnyways, I still think it's a solid book because Suzanne Collins is just a queen when it comes to well-written plots. You can really feel that this woman put hours upon hours into coming up with a concept of this book, and you were never left with the feeling that she did something without a second thought. And, of course, she's the queen of plot twists. Due to the fact that I knew what was going to happen, these plot twists didn't hit as hard as the first time around, but I still cannot deny them their brilliance: 1) Prim being the chosen one at the reaping, and not Katniss (which would've been the obvious choice in any other YA series), 2) Peeta dropping the love bomb during his interview with Caesar, 3) Peeta joining the Career pack in the arena, and 4) the rule changes regarding whether or not two tributes from the same district can win the games together. All of these twists are so clever and add great excitement to the story.\\n\\nHowever, during my reread the book as a whole couldn't really hold my excitement throughout. I definitely have my favorite characters (Gale, Prim, Haymitch ...), so whenever they were around I was happy and content. In general, wherever Prim was concerned, I was immediately on the verge of tears. Boy oh boy, her relationship to Katniss is so precious and how she insisted that she must win, and Katniss then promised to come back for her. WE LOVE TO SEE IT! And Gale and Katniss are just a great match (imo), I love that he calls her \\\"Kätzchen\\\" (\\\"Catnip\\\" in the original) and that the both of them are only at ease when they're together in the forest. I just love that their bond is so strong. And what a lot of people seem to forget is that the only reason Prim is still alive is because of Gale, and that he, in Katniss' absence, came through and provided meat to her family as well... so please stop hating on this boy.\\n\\nBut especially Katniss' relationship to Peeta still bores me to death. I'm happy to report that I like and understand Peeta as an individual character way better this time around (I used to hate him when I was younger) but I still stand by the fact that he and Katniss have zero chemistry and that they shouldn't be together. They're just so boring. Also, if Suzanne Collins brings up the bread incident ONE MORE TIME, I will literally riot. I don't care. Get over it.\\n\\nOne thing that I thought whilst rereading this book is that it would've been fascinating to have a book from Thresh's perspective. He's probably my new-found favorite character in here. He's so intense. During his interview with Caesar, he only replied with \\\"yes\\\" or \\\"no\\\" (ICONIC), he has his own fucking area in the arena because everyone's afraid of him, he actually GAINED SOME POUNDS during the so-called games (I cannot even!)... and when he beat Clove to death with a rock (WE LOVE TO SEE IT) and spared Katniss' life because she protected Rue ... I was all like YOU ARE MY CHAMPION, I am betting on you. I'm still mad that we never learn the specifics of how he died? Was it Cato? Was it the game runners? Why did Suzanne Collins decide to write a book about young President Snow and his love for a tribute from District 12 (WHO CARES???) when she could've written about Thresh? I'm bitter.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I have not much else to say but I would like to recap some of the moments that I forgot about because they are different in the movies: it was Katniss' mom who gave her the mockingjay pin; Haymitch knocking Peeta out after they gang up on him on the train (ICONIC!); Katniss getting her body hair removed; Cinna telling Katniss that he specifically asked to be the stylist for district 12; Katniss wanting to ride the elevator twice because it’s so much fun; Rue telling Katniss how strict the guards are in district 11; Peeta’s father was in love with Katniss’ mother when they were younger (YIKES); The beasts ate at Cato for over an hour (!) before Katniss took mercy on him and shot him down; Peeta kissing Katniss for 10 minutes straight during the victory ceremony and shoving Caesar out of the way (EWWW).\\n\\nAnd two moments that had me absolutely SHOOK were when District 11 sent Katniss that loaf of bread (which must've cost them a hell of a lot of money) to show their gratitude. I cannot even. I didn't even cry during Rue's death even though the singing, the flowers and Katniss' gesture were well written, but when she received that bread, man, ... the only time I cried during this reread.\\n\\nThe other moment that had me SHOOK was when we learn at the end that the Capitol actually wanted Katniss to undergo breast surgery to look presentable (WTF) but Haymitch screamed the whole place down and averted that. HOLY SMOKES! In general, Haymitch really shines (in the book as well as in the movie) and I love how he and Katniss are just on a similar wave length. I mean, she's the only one who gets what kind of a hell this man must've lived through for the past 30 years, mentoring two tributes every year just to watch them die a couple of weeks later. Bitch, I would be drinking as well.\\n\\nOh, and Katniss shooting the apple in the pig’s mouth is big dick energy and you can’t tell me otherwise.\\n\\nSo, yeah, is still a solid kick-off to the book series as a whole and I am actually looking forward to reading the second book because I love the premise of it and seeing all the older victors come back to the arena is just so damn exciting!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Okay, so as Milan pointed out everybody and their dog is reading this series, so I did too! It sounded exciting, fast-paced with action, romance and adventure, set in a dystopian society where children are forced to participate in deatchmatches which are a form of official entertainment. What more could a reader want?\\n\\nWell, it turned out that this reader could want quite a lot more. Since I am a well known reading snob who only reads mass-markets found in drugstores and at bus stops I'm going to bitch what I didn't like, but first I'll say what I liked. Well, the cover is nice, and so is the title, but that's about it.\\n\\nSet in post-apocalyptic North America, instantly brings to mind , the book or the film. Add to these cool teenage protagonists, some sort of Anime cosplay costumes designed by cool designers (in this book you go to the scaffold with style!) and you should have the latest teen craze which would disappear from shelves like my grandmother's homemade pierogies when I'm in her town. And, of course, you'd be right.\\n\\nOnly is nowhere near as meaty as good pierogies, even those with cheese stuffing. It's a very quick read, because the writing style is rather simplistic. The present tense narrative should allow for closeness and attachment to the main character, Katniss, and her feelings and emotions, only either I'm getting old or am a bastard because I found it hard to give a crap about what she thinks or feels. Maybe the character was just flat as a board, or I'm getting to old for this, since this is a book aimed at teenagers. I failed to care about any of the characters and found most events to be unsurprising except for a weird thing which occured near the end of the book, but it was not quite enough to save it as a whole for me. I found the romance part to be quite emotionless and the only chemistry to be found was in the big apple which I ate when reading this book because it was as big as a tire. So, the straight forward writing serves the action scenes well, and to give the author credit there's a lot of them but they're all that there is to it, and such themes and motives have been carried out earlier by other writers.\\n\\nTo sum up: reads like a bag of chips, meaning you can devour it in several short bites but it will leave you unnourished and aside from some gas won't have much effect. If you'll pardon the pun, it left me hungry. I might still read the other two books in the series because they read so fast and you can always do with more bragging about the number of books you've read, and there's supposed to be a rebellion or something in the second one and the third one has a cool title. Stay tuned!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I was very reluctant in starting this series. Not because I suspected it bad, but I had read other books which are inspired by this series. I was afraid I wouldn’t enjoy it that much. But I was totally wrong.\\nThis book was great! I enjoyed it very much even though regardless of it been similar to other YA books…Oh sorry…other YA books been similar to this series. 😅😅 .\\n.\\nThe novel is set in the country of Panem which is the north America after the apocalyptic events. It consists of 12 districts and a capital named Capitol. These districts have only one job which is to serve Capitol. Hunger Games is the name of game which is played between 24 players (𝟷 𝘣𝘰𝘺 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝟷 𝘨𝘪𝘳𝘭 𝘣𝘦𝘵𝘸𝘦𝘦𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘢𝘨𝘦 𝘰𝘧 𝟷𝟸 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝟷𝟾 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘮 𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘩 𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘤𝘵). These players are supposed to kill each other and the last man surviving wins.\\nKatniss is the girl from District 12 and her sister is chosen to play in Hunger Games. Katniss volunteers in place of her sister and now she has to go through the Games!\\n.\\n.\\n-I got some vibes of book 1984. I loved that book too. The whole idea of govt watching your every step seems to be little bit inspired by that. But I loved it.\\n-I had very mixed views of Katniss but I understood her reasons too. Survival was her need and she did everything for it. I liked her…but looking forward to love her in next book.\\n-Peeta. I loved him very much. He was kind hearted and sweet and cute too. I felt bad for him sometimes… But that was what it was…nothing could be down. ☹😢\\n-Gale. I liked him too. he wasn’t here for a long time but I suspect there would be plenty of him in the next book.\\n-I loved the whole idea of arena and plot. I didn’t expect arena to be that huge but it was and I loved it.\\n-People of Capitol were so…weird. They enjoyed watching this killing game. I liked some of their people...but overall, I found them very weird. But they are supposed to be that way.\\n.\\n.\\nI have very high hopes for the sequel now. I also really hope its movie would be as great as it features Jenifer Lawrence. 😍 Will watch the movie now. Yayy! 😁 .\\n.\\nQOTD: Did think this book had a touch of 1984?\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Suzanne Collins is simply amazing and \\\"The Hunger Games\\\" will always be one of my all-time favorites. This tale of oppression and hope had me from Katniss' first no nonsense description of her no-frills relationship with Buttercup.\\n\\n\\\"No hissing. Entrails... the closest we will ever come to love.\\\"\\n\\nShe's such a great heroine because she's so relatable. Hasn't had an easy life. Can't get her words out right when she needs to. Tries to do the right thing. Isn't sure how she feels about a boy who is her best friend and another one who she's quietly thought about for years. Would do anything to save her sister. And her story is so hard to put down, dragging you with her as Prim is reaped and she volunteers. As Twelve stands in silence and something is born, and as Peeta Mellark, the boy with the bread, has his name plucked from the reaping bowl. Just gorgeous writing.\\n\\nCollins does such a great job with the romance with these two because it's sweet, it's flawed in places, and has its rocky points. Katniss has a hard time accessing her emotions because she's never had time to sit down and think of the luxury of falling in love. And yet Collins slips it in on the page anyway, there from the first moment she picks up those loaves of bread in the rain. A must-read. 5/5 stars.\"\n",

I can't put my problem in the words, but something was off. maybe this whole hunting, mining or treatments with herbs in a future society? maybe the choking with fear made it dark & more like a medieval era.\\n-\\nWritten Style: ★★★/5\\nfirst person view of a heroine, present tenses... not really a fan. (I guess probably because it implies as if I'm doing this stuff, & I would never act like that or behave this way. especially when it's narrated with present tenses, doesn't feel like a journal or something happened in the past.)\\nbut at least it doesn't seem like a fanfiction, the descriptions, the occasional backstories proves that the writing style is rich.\\n\\nترجمه اش هم خوب نبود، خیلی کتابی بود، دیالوگها رو حداقل باید عامیانه ترجمه میکردن\\n-\\nIdea: ★★★/5\\nthe idea was kind of lame & cruel, I mean Hunger game!? to make them fear? to kill each other? really? they are just children.\\n\\nin general, I like the Divergent better in dystopian post-apocalypse style.\\n\\np.s.

I read this book in a day.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nDear Ms Collins,\\n\\nI think I speak on behalf of most young adult readers when I say thank you for writing a series that allows us to say “I told you so” when every single person we recommend the book to devours it within a day and adores it.\\n\\nI may be speaking for myself here but when I say “I read the books before I saw the film” about the Hunger Games, I will say it loud and proud .\\nThank you for showing everyone that it’s OK to be a Katniss kinda gal.\\n\\nForever a fan,\\nJo.\\n\\nx\\n\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nDear Katniss,\\n\\nCompassionate. Brutal. Awkward. Strong. Loyal. Looks good with a side plait. [It’s a difficult look to pull off, believe you me.]\\nIt’s all been said before and I hope it gets said again and again. With you, we readers finally got a heroine who wasn’t afraid to stand up for what they believe in. And also, a heroine who didn’t just believe in boys and kissing.\\n\\nYou are the ultimate.\\n\\nYours always,\\nJo.\\nxxx\\n\\nps. I have also been keeping track of the boy with the bread. When I say ‘keep track of’ I mean ‘fancied the pants off’….\\n\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nDear Peeta,\\nIt struck me when I read the entirely fictional account of the 74th Hunger Games how hilarious you are. For some reason, I forgot this in the lull between the first reading of the book and the second reading. I like how you are actually a character with your own personality and not just one of the tired YA boy clichés that get paraded out when the heroine needs to look ‘feminine’ and ‘normal’ and less “squirrel-killery”. Because, obviously, kissing boys is the only way this can be done, right?\\nAnyway, I think I have done you a great disservice by describing you as the ‘nice’ guy when I have been recommending this book to my family and my friends and that weird woman who wouldn’t leave me alone when I was waiting at the train station.\\nSo, for that, I apologise.\\nI mean, you are nice but you also have an incredibly dry humour which I adore so much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou’re also so incredibly swoony and I would like to cuddle in a cave with you while you whisper sweet nothings into my ear.\\nAnd when I say ‘cuddle in a cave’ I mean in a fancy restaurant where an oddly attractive psychopath isn’t out for our blood. And there would probably be profiteroles.\\nAnd when I say ‘sweet nothings’ I mean recipes for delicious cakes...\\n\\nIt will be a cold day in hell when I don’t fancy a boy who can provide me with regular baked products.\\nI LOVE BREAD AND I LOVE YOU.\\n\\nLots of love,\\nJo.\\nxxx\\n\\n--------------------------\\n\\nG-\\nI always root for the underdog.\\n\\n*sigh*\\nAlso, I always root for the tall, fit hunter-gatherer type who would always be there to protect the heroine but lets her protect herself because he knows she could do it just as well, if not better, than he could and he respects that and encourages her strength.\\nProbs just me.\\n\\n--------------------------\\n\\nHaymitch, mate, you need to ring me.\\nYou left your phone at my house and god it’s been ringing off the hook. Effie really wanted to speak to you, dunno what about. I listened to some of the messages (God, she’s shrill, isn’t she?) and all I got from it was that Katniss needed you to get her something. Something about Katniss not being able to find water and needing you to send her some? Or else she was gonna die? Ha. Effie is such a drama queen, isn’t she?\\nDoes that make any sense to you?\\nNah, I didn’t get it either.\\nAnyway, last Friday was BRILLIANT. Remember? We got really drunk and we ended up on that pedalo? And then we were in that club and you requested from the DJ and I was like “THIS SONG IS ABOUT ME!” and you were like “OMG THIS SONG REALLY ALL ABOUT YOU!!\\n…..\\nYou really don’t remember?\\nAnyway, we need to do that again because us two, H? We’re in it for the long haul. I know what happens in the Capitol stays in the Capitol but I guess it’s also the law…\\n\\n‘Til Sambuca do us part,\\nJo.\\nxxx\\n\\nps. Do you have my left shoe? I’ve looked all over Panem and I can’t find it.\\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nDearest Cin,\\n\\nCan I call you Cin? You never replied to my other letter so I’m guessing it’s OK. Anyway, Cin… speaking of those other letters, do you have an answer for me?\\nWould you be willing to be my Life Coach? I know it would be a bit of a task because, well, I’m pretty much failing at all things life-related but this is where you come in.\\nJust picture it, we could go shopping. We could talk about make-up. You could diagnose what the hell is going on with my hair. We could talk about politics.\\nMe and Katniss are practically best friends too, so you could go ahead and book is in on the same session.\\nIt’ll be glorious and just think how satisfying it would be to succeed. We could do a Before and After kind of thing. Or make it into a reality TV show?!?!\\nWe could be the next Audrey and Rex!\\nAnyway, I’ve included a self-addressed envelope just in case you lost my address.\\nCan’t wait to hear back from you!\\n\\nxoxoxo\\n\\nps. I spent about three hours in Boots looking at gold eye-liner last weekend. I just couldn’t decide whether I would suit it or not. I think it takes a certain kind of person to wear that colour, you know? So instead I went to get a meal deal but the woman on the til said I couldn’t have two brownies and a Diet Coke instead of a sandwich, a brownie and a Diet Coke. So I glowered at her for a bit and bought the two brownies anyway and then added another one to my basket IN PROTEST. And I refused to get an advantage card. TO SPITE HER.\\n\\npps. See? Life failing, thy name is Jo. HELP.\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\\nDear Rue,\\n\\nYou know when you’re trying to sleep in in the mornings and there’s that bloody annoying bird outside your window that is just screeching and squawking and you’re just like “HOLY MOCKINGJAY WOULD YOU SHUT UP?!?!?”\\nThat was me trying to send you a message via a wood pigeon. I learnt too late that they are Mockingjays and they do not have the ability to send messages.\\nSo… um.. sorry for the squawking and disturbing your Sunday lie-ins.\\nBasically, I just wanted to say that you’re a wonderful little girl and if I think about it really hard, you’re the starting point for everything that happens in this book.\\n\\nLove you,\\n\\nJo.\\nxxx\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\\nDearest Finnick,\\nYes, I know you’re not in this book but I wanted to just let you know that I will be reading Catching Fire again in the near future and I am SO EXCITED because you are one of my favourite fictional boys ever.\\nAlso, I have missed it when you take off your top randomly and show your abs.\\n\\nKISSES AND ETERNAL LOVE FOREVER AND EVER,\\nJo.\\nxxxxxxxx\\nxxxxxxx\\nxxxxxx\\nxxxxx\\nxxxx\\nxx\\nx\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nDear Jennifer Lawrence,\\n\\nI can’t decide whether I am more in love with your boyfriend or you.\\nWho am I kidding?

      "      \"review\": \"What's the point of living in goodness , if you're going to die as a monster? The Hunger Games trilogy was the first YA story I read that treated youngs with both respect and coldness, without filters and right to the point. It set the bar so high for me that after it, every book in the genre I have read is simply not good enough. This first installment gives us an incredibly strong, fierce, human main charachter with a perfect development, a society eerily allegorical to our reality, with a moral of respect and love among the most desperate of situations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo recuerdo como me entere de la existencia de este libro, creo que fue cuando adquirieron los derechos para la película, o no recuerdo, pero tras haberlo leído, encendió una chispa por la lectura que hasta la fecha no he podido apagar.\\n\\nA la fregada, le daré las 5 estrellas por que se las merece, punto final. Me he leído libros muy buenos en toda mi vida, de verdad, libros mucho muy buenos, pero la gran mayoría solo se quedan en eso, Los Juegos del Hambre es ESE tipo de libros.\\n\\nCollins hace un gran trabajo como escritora, el primer libro siempre es el más difícil, hay que saber dar a entender la trama general y el personaje principal de manera al menos buena, o todo se cae. Y Collins lo hace estupendamente. Entiendes la perversidad detrás de los juegos, pero no es si no hasta mas adelante, como a la mitad del libro que te das cuenta de porque le han funcionado tan bien al Capitolio por 74 años.\\n\\nMe gustan los personajes con metas simples pero importantes en la vida, y Katniss no es mas que eso, una persona con tan poco, que puede contar las personas que le importan con los dedos de las manos, que no puede aspirar a algo grande. Y leer como pasa de ser una chica de mente cerrada, distante y con solo un objetivo que seguir a este personaje fuerte pero con emociones, inteligente pero con necesidad, arrogante pero con caridad y con una visión más amplia del mundo en el que habita es simplemente fascinante.\\n\\nKatniss aprende gracias a Rue y Peeta que . Que se puede ser humano aun cuando todo a tu alrededor te impide que lo seas. Y un libro que es capaz darte pensamientos tan positivos creando un mundo con tanta negatividad y dolor merece todas las buenas críticas que tiene.\\n\\nEl libro tiene otra cosa muy importante a resaltar y es: Los reality TV Shows y toda esa mierda asquerosa! Nombren el que ustedes quieran, da igual porque ES UNA MIERDA! Enserio, cual es el siguiente paso?.\\n\\nY así puedo seguir, todo el día, hablando sobre porque\\n\\nEn cuanto a los personajes secundarios, aunque no se ve mucho crecimiento por su parte, me gusta que sean todos tan variados. Me encantan las personalidades tan distintas de Katniss y Peeta, me encanta todo lo que aprende de el, y como se complementan. Soy una fan de las parejas con personalidades distintas, o tal vez no soy fan de las parejas con personalidades iguales, no lo se, el punto es que hay muy pocas historias románticas que me llenen y la de Katniss y Peeta es una de ellas. :'D\\n\\nAgregándole que el libro tiene muy buena información de supervivencia, y buenas escenas de acción, un ritmo muy fluido y una seguridad en su propia historia digna de aplaudirse.\\n\\nNo creo que tenga que decir esto dado todo lo que ha crecido esta historia por si sola y ahora con las películas (que me encantan por cierto) pero si por alguna razón extraña no lo has leído, dale una oportunidad.\\n\\n\\nComo le hace? Enserio, como le hace esta mujer Suzanne Collins? Dios mío! Había olvidado por completo lo tristes, crueles y horribles que eran los últimos capítulos. Lo mucho que tocan la fibra sentimental. Y es que en la película no es tan intenso el final. En tan pocas hojas, te hace llorar, enojar, odiar y querer. Te da esperanza, te la quita, te la vuelve a dar, te la vuelve a quitar, Te deja llorando en posición fetal. D: y con muchas, muchas ganas de leer el siguiente.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMe gusto. Bastante. Salí de esa sala muy feliz y contenta con la adaptación, las actuaciones, etc. No, no fue perfecta, pero es sin duda el mejor inicio de franquicia que he visto. Mucha gente se queja de que la cámara se movía mucho, pero yo nunca lo sentí, al contrario hacia que todo se viera mas real, como si estuvieras ahí detrás de Katniss corriendo. Sin duda lo mas fuerte es el casting, sobretodo . Si alguno de los dos hubiera fallado, TODA esta franquicia hubiera muerto, pero esos dos lo LOGRARON! Hice todo lo que una fangirl haría, grite, se me salieron lagrimas, reí, salte, aplaudí, pero lo mejor de todo, después al salir de la película e intentar verla con ojo critico, pude decir,\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"First, welcome to reading, I'm glad this could be one of 5 books you read this year along with The Help. Please stick around, there are many more worlds to explore and adventures to have. But I'm glad peer pressure can at least get you to read something. I know this is super elitist, I'm sorry, but I don't like pop music either and this is the Katy Perry of the literary world. I know, reading is always good blah blah blah it's still a good book blah blah you're kind of being a jerk here. I know but does anyone feel the same sometimes?\\n\\nThis is my review from a couple years ago, forgot to post it here from the blog:\\n\\nI have this obsession, and I know it drives my wife nuts, but I can't stand wasting time. That's why audiobooks are by friends. Anytime I'm driving, taking the bus, walking to school, it's all good book-reading time. It's all forward progression, especially since I usually have goals to read so many books a month, quarter, year, etc. And I've found that most libraries have a decent selection of audiobooks since they tend to be a bit pricey.\\n\\nNow getting to the review. I'm terrible with peer pressure, I know. Everyone else seems to be reading this series and then I found it in the library. From there it was settled. (I'm still impressed I've resisted the Twilight fad for this long)\\n\\nGoodreads blurb:\\n\\nIn a future North America, where the rulers of Panem maintain control through an annual televised survival competition pitting young people from each of the twelve districts against one another, sixteen-year-old Katniss's skills are put to the test when she voluntarily takes her younger sister's place.\\n\\nI came really close to giving up on The Hunger Games (Book 1 of 3) after the first few CDs. It was really frustrating how subservient these people are who live in each of the districts. They're on the brink of starvation, the rulers make it illegal to go hunting (although that's one place they actually break the rules), they can't say anything remotely seditious against the ruling class and to top it off they send two kids from each of their districts to compete in a \\\"game\\\" where they have to kill each other off - the winner is the one who out-survives the rest.\\n\\nThe book explains that no one fights back because the elusive District 13 was utterly decimated. But seriously? People who are starving anyway have nothing to lose, a quick death by decimation is much better than slowly wasting away. Not only that, you have the parents. Who would continue to let their children go off to fight to the death and not do something about it, or at least just not be so submissive to everything?\\n\\nThe kids arrive at the compound where they train and get ready for the games and yet again, they are completely afraid to break any rules. And yet again, what do they have to lose? They're about to go try to kill each other, why don't they do something? This is somewhat explained away because \\\"sponsors\\\" can help you throughout the game by sending you things you need and they'll only do that if they like you and you're in compliance with the rules.\\n\\nYet, I couldn't help but think that people would still be fighting back. But anyway, once I got over these couple niggles, I did I promise, The Hunger Games was a fairly enjoyable read.\\n\\nCollins has created an interesting futuristic world where the ruling class keeps the people under their firm grasp by subjecting them to the horrible atrocities that are the Hunger Games. I thought she did a great job showing the intrigue of the games - that they were about more than just who's the biggest, strongest, fastest.\\n\\nOnce the Hunger Games themselves began, I was sucked in. The game designers plan a number of surprises and tricks to not only weaken the players but to bring them together. Whatever gives the most entertainment for the legions of crowds watching the grisly show. These were all really interesting and helped to move the plot forward very quickly, because I, like the insensitive crowd, like my entertainment too. :)\\n\\nAlmost immediately, the players created alliances (Survivor style) and it was interesting to see the dynamic especially since they all knew only one person would live. This was done quite well and even created some interesting twists.\\n\\nIt's interesting to note that The Hunger Games have been optioned by Lions Gate films and I'll be interested to see the movie. You always have to see if they got it right. :)\\n\\n\\nWhen Should You Read The Hunger Games?\\n\\nWhen you're in the mood for something light and definitely young adult, The Hunger Games may be the way to go. I'm probably the only one who had the issues I had with the book, so don't let that hold you back.\\n\\n3 out of 5 Stars (liked it)\"\n",

I understand that this book has the popularity it has because of what the story is about and it is not bad at all, since it has all the features to be a \\\"Best-seller\\\". About the plot itself, it is good, creative and sad if you look at it from a deeper or more serious point of view. For some reason, it reminds me of North Korea because all the hate is focused on the Capitol (or capital) and well, no need to talk about the freedom the people in Panem have.\\nI hope that we will never ever have to find out a country like that.... that forces you to kill other people from other districts (Or cities) in order to survive and all the people are forced to see the murders, suffer and blood. Quite diabolical if it's analyzed from a serious perspective.\\nAs previously said, the story itself is very catchy, but very predictable and even a bit non-sense to me. Hence, my review is 3 stars (2.5 actually). I could guess several things that happened and several times I was lik \\\"Meh... too lucky\\\" or \\\"What a coincidence!\\\". I don't blame the write at all, since she wrote a best-seller and oh Gosh she succeeded. After reading the end, I don't think a second (and third) part is necessary, but we will see how the second book is.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTenía ganas de leer un libro así: Que sea fácil de leer, fácil de seguir y que no te haga pensar tanto. Entiendo que este libro tiene la popularidad que tiene por lo que cuenta la historia, y no está nada de mal ya que tiene todas las características de ser un \\\"Best seller\\\".

Por algún motivo, me recuerda a Corea del Norte, ya que todo está en el Capitolio (O la capital) y bueno, no hace falta decir la falta de libertad que los habitantes de Panem tienen.\\nEspero que nunca en la vida tengamos que descubrir un país así: Que te obliga a matar a otras personas de otro distritos -o ciudades- para poder sobrevivir, y que todo el pueblo esté obligado a ver todos los asesinatos, sufrimiento y sangre. Bastante satánico, si se le mira con seriedad y cordura.\\nLa historia en sí, como antes dicho, es incluso atrapadora, pero bastante predescible e incluso surreal para mí, por ende le pongo 3 estrellas (2,5 en verdad). Pude intuir varias de las cosas que pasarían y en muchos momentos era como \\\"Meh, demasiada suerte\\\" o \\\"Demasiada coincidencia\\\"... pero no culpo a la autora, ya que escribió una historia a las masas y lo logró con creces. Después de leer el final, no encuentro necesario que haya una segunda -y tercera- parte, pero veremos qué tal el segundo libro.\"\n",

I love you girlie! Thanks for being patient with my slow reading!! <33 Here is her beautiful review: Go check it out!!\\n\\n\\n\\nThe plot is definitely my favorite aspect of The Hunger Games. This book has the kind of plot that even though it’s 3 in the morning. With many twists, turns, and cliffhangers, you will want to keep reading.\\n\\nSet in a future North America known as \\\"Panem\\\", the Capitol selects a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the twelve outlying districts to compete in the annual \\\"Hunger Games\\\", a televised fight-to-the-death. The film is centered around Katniss Everdeen - a 16-year-old girl from District 12, who volunteers for her 12-year-old sister, Prim, when Prim's name is chosen - and Katniss's fellow District 12 tribute, Peeta Mellark, with whom she has some rather dramatic history. Katniss is then rushed to the Capitol, where she undergoes intense training before being thrust into the arena to fight to become the victor of the seventy-fourth annual Hunger Games.\\n\\n(I only feel like including 4)\\nKatniss is the main character. To be honest, I find her personality annoying. Her whole vibe gives: I’m not like the other girls. 🤭 Her actions, on the other hand, make me love and respect her. Katniss does make some idiotic choices throughout the whole book, but she makes it look like a little mistake the whole time.\\nThe bread boy who is named after a type of bread! My favorite character by far!! Peeta is one of Katniss’ love interests. (He’s the better one if you didn’t know 😚) He is also a tribute for District 12, like Katniss.\\nKatniss’ other love interest.\\nMy second favorite character. A tribute from District 11. -Insert little Hunger Games song riff thing-\\n\\nThis book is Whether you’re a teen or an adult, this book is for everyone! The cover is also beautiful and the setup of the book makes it even more satisfying to read.\\n\\n\\n‘I do not want to lose the boy with the bread.’ -Katniss Everdeen\\n‘District 12. Where you can starve to death in safety.’ -Katniss Everdeen\\n‘I am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as the sun.’ -Katniss Everdeen\\n“You’ve got as much charm as a dead slug.” -Haymitch\\n“You almost look like a human being now!” 😚 -Flavius\\n\\n\\n, by Fall Out Boy\\n, by Rihanna\\n, by Taylor Swift\\n, by Imagine Dragons\\n, by Taylor Swift\\n, by Sabrina Carpenter\\n, by Imagine Dragons\\n, by Taylor Swift, The Civil Wars\\n, by 5 Seconds of Summer\\n, by Rihanna\\n\\nPeople I’ve recommended this book to have said that they don’t want to read it, only because all they do in it is try to kill each other. This is not true. There is quite a bit of fighting and violence, but\\n\\nYou will enjoy the movie a lot more if you read the book first, I promise you.

      "      \"review\": \"I’d just like to say, I have NO IDEA why it took me so long to actually read this book considering within the first two pages I was hooked! I finished this book and thought “So THIS is what all the fuss is about!”.\\n\\nThe premise of The Hunger Games is somewhat disturbing. It’s a dystopian novel and is set in a not-too-distant future in what used to be America. America has collapsed due to natural disasters, famine and war and the country of Panem has replaced it. Panem is divided into the Capitol (basically the head honcho government area), and 12 districts. The capitol force two representatives aged 11-18 to participate in the annual Hunger Games – a brutal and cruel fight to the death – for their enjoyment and entertainment and these games are broadcasted throughout Panem and are compulsory to watch as the 24 participants are forced to eliminate eachother.\\n\\nSixteen year old Katniss’s young sister, Prim, is selected as the suffering and deprived District 12′s representative. Katniss volunteers to take her place and finds herself thrown in the Hunger Games, on television in front of the entire nation. Katniss and the male District 12 representative, Peeta are pitted against stronger, bigger and faster opponents, especially those who are Career Districts, those who have trained for the games their whole lives.\\n\\nCollins’ creates characters who have so much depth and are so realistic. This book had me captivated from the get go. I adore Katniss, she is so real, is a real heroine and a true survivor – plus she’s awesome with a bow and arrow! Katniss may raise some eyebrows, but I did not question her at all. If I was thrown into a giant arena with nothing but the clothes on my back and had to kill 23 others and survive in the wilderness, I reckon I’d die pretty easily and would definitely not be as clever as Katniss.\\n\\nThis book had me feeling so many things, I felt anger, sadness, betrayal, fear, hopelessness, grief, guilt and happiness. The only thing I think I can find fault in this novel is that the sentences were a bit choppy and I found it a bit disorienting, but I think this is what Ms. Collins wanted and it was successful in making the story really come alive and in making you feel like you were really watching Katniss and like you were there with her.\\n\\nI think you’re just going to have to read the book rather than this review because I simply can’t put everything I love about this book into words. This is one of those books where someone says “This book is AMAZING”, it really is, seriously.\\n\\nAnother thing I’d love to see is a map of Panem and the 12 districts, the wilderness and the 13th district that was destroyed. THAT would be pretty awesome!\"\n",

I have never read her work til now.\\n\\nHow can I say this?? I liked the storyline, it was pretty good but I could not get into the story. For me there was very little detail. I could not picture the characters feelings or their actions. The on!y detailed piece was when Katniss' friend or ally, Rue, was dying. Katniss sang to her and comforted her. In my opinion, that was in great detail. I could feel her sadness and her anger for the games. I just could not stop crying in that part. After that, I kept falling asleep because it got boring.\\n\\nI could not see how this book could have been addictive or great. It just is not. This book took me 5 days to read. Now that is saying something when it comes to me. For a good or great book, it usually takes me 1 - 3 days to read.\\n\\nMaybe it is just me.... Maybe it just being the first book.

      "      \"review\": \"The Hunger Games didn't impress me.\\n\\nWhen I'm reading a book, especially a speculative fiction book, the first thing I look for is illogical plot holes. I hate them. They ruin books for me. Take Death Note for instance, or even Glee. They are so full of plot holes and illogical inconsistencies, they aren't worth my time. If the author was too lazy to do a bit of research why should I invest myself in their work?\\n\\nThat is how I feel about the Hunger Games.\\n\\nSure, the writing isn't bad. I guess Katniss could be considered a strong female character. She kept it together and didn't freak out. She was tough and resilient. But sometimes you want more than that. I like snark, I like humor, I like cynicism. I know there isn't a place for that in most dystopian novels, but you have to make me love the characters. You have to give them some heart. Look at the Animorphs. We had humor and science. I think that's the thing most serious writers miss out on.\\n\\nBut I digress. I started the Hunger Games with high expectations. I thought it would be mind blowing.\\n\\nIt wasn't.\\n\\nAnyone who's read Octavia Butler or Philip K. Dick won't be impressed. Sure it's YA but honestly, is that an excuse for lazy world building?\\n\\nPanem is the remnants of the US divided into thirteen districts. The entire political and economical situation of Panem is highly illogical. This is my problem with Avatar: The Last Airbender. When you try to make sense out of the world, nothing fits. Then you're told that you're looking too hard into things, that it's a fantasy world. Sure it's a fantasy world, but we still have rules. If this were and alien world with an alien culture, maybe I'd agree. But this is still Earth. Last time I checked, they were still human.\\n\\nDuring slavery times in the US, slaves were looked at as less than human. Now I know the people of Panem aren't slaves. So why are they following this system? In Santa Domingo, the people were enslaved and forced to work for 300 years. They didn't have the freedom the people of Panem have. They rebelled, and after 10 years or so they won. They had to fight again and again, but they maintained their freedom from the French. Those people are the Haitians of today.\\n\\nLet's look at any civil war situation on the globe. The closest situation I can think of is in Southern Africa. There, children are forced to fight in wars and carry guns. They kill each other. There, they have their hands cut off if they refuse to fight. Did I mention that they're also in a complete system of disarray? I don't believe that Americans can safely travel there. Why isn't Panem like this? I could have accepted the Hunger Games as a whole if, and only if, their country was in a complete state of havoc. It isn't. Apparently each of the districts get along just fine, supplying the capital with goods. What's with that?\\n\\nAnd the kicker is, their Ghandi figure, their Martin Luther King Jr., is a teenage girl and her boyfriend. This is our symbol to teens. Apparently, teen love does stop wars, the Earth, and the universe. Look over here, teens fall in love and the gods present us with peace and tranquility for years to come. Yes, the books only continue to get even more illogical.\\n\\nFor a system like this to work, I'd have to have a lot of back story to explain the country's situation. I understand that district 13 was blown off the face of the Earth. So was part of Japan for a period of time. You know, some say they don't even teach their kids about WWII over there. But did that stop the Korean War? Did that stop Vietnam? No. And you can bet those wars weren't started by the love of two teens.\\n\\nThis series could have been brilliant. It had excellent potential. Unfortunately, besides the illogical world building and the gaping plot holes, there's a problem with pacing.\\n\\nThe actual Hunger Games doesn't start until at least one third of the book is over. That's bad pacing. If this were a movie, that's like Nemo getting kidnapped one third of the way into the movie. Also, we waste time building up Gale and Priss, only to find out that they're not even major players in this book. I know it's a series, but a book should be able to stand on it's own. The Chronicles of Narnia do. The first three Harry Potter books do.\\n\\nInstead, we're stuck with Peeta. He's okay, but he's not interesting. The romance felt tacked on. If the capital is swayed by their ridiculous love story, I swear, they're no better than a bunch of Rose/Dimitri fan girls. Also, we're introduced to interesting characters, such as Haymitch, Cinna, and so on, only for them to be left out of the rest of the book. Either this is a post-apocalyptic/action novel or a character study. It can't be both unless you write it well. It certainly can't be a romance if the heroine isn't even sure she likes the Hero. It was kind of obvious from the first few chapters that Katniss liked Gale. It was even more obvious that he liked her. Of course it has to be strung out into a love triangle for the next few books. *Spoiler* Of course he goes evil and she ends up with Peeta.*End Spoiler*\\n\\nThere was so much hype behind this book, I expected it to be fantastic. Maybe if it wasn't so popular, I'd have a different opinion. But as it is, bad pacing and stupid world building are not the hallmarks of a fabulous novel.\\n\\n3.0 stars. It's about as average as they come.\"\n",

I'm also planning on making a start on the book soon.\\n\\nWell, I really enjoyed it! This is the story of the Minotaur revamped for modern times. A mythical creature, part man part bull, the Minotaur was confined to the palace of King Minos in Crete in a special maze-like construction called the Labyrinth. When Minos won the war against Athens, he imposed a penalty on the Athenians: the sacrifice of 7 young men and 7 young women every 9 years, who were made to enter the labyrinth and be devoured by the frustrated Minotaur.\\n\\nSuzanne Collins uses this idea as the basis for her novel but sets the events at a dystopian future time in Panem. The country is being governed by President Snow, a media-savvy dictator that has imposed a similar penalty on the 12 districts that surround the Capitol for their participation in a rebellion that shook the system many years before. Since then, a man and a woman from each district are chosen by lot each year to participate in the Hunger Games from which only one victor comes out alive.\\n\\nNeedless to say, this story will appeal to those who seek tightly-packed action and suspense. I enjoyed some of the more political elements in Collin's retelling of the myth, esp. the emphasis on the exploitation of the Districts for their labour power and wealth. Most of the inhabitants of the poorer Districts are black, and they are worked to death for the wealth of the Capitol. Some more modern elements are there too, esp. the power of tv and media. The classical Greek references are augmented with Roman themes; for exampe, the young men and women are not sacrificed outright but are instead made to fight in an arena reminiscent of the Colosseum.\\n\\nAs usual with action stories of this type, the plot relies a lot on the fight between good and evil. I normally avoid such books/films because I find them crude, but this particular story is a little more subtle with several reversals going on. I also liked the fact that victory in the Games is not the end of the story (of the happily ever after type...) but the beginning of a new saga where victors are put on show for the benefit of President Snow. The Districts are in turmoil, revolution is in the air, and the price of disobedience is death! What not to like?\\n\\n:\\n\\nHaving now read the book, it'd give it\\n\\nThere are very few differences between the book and the film, in fact, the film is so faithful to the book that the reader gets the impression that Suzanne Collins wrote it with a view to the film. Why then only three stars? Well, the fast-paced action and strong characters work really well in a movie, however, the book would require something extra to make it special. While reading, I constantly felt that it lacked depth. It was as if the author had borrowed the main idea from Big Brother (or Masterchef), where a number of contestants compete for a prize, and recycled it to suit a dystopian world where contenstants fight to the death. But - and this is a big but - a fight to the death is not the same as fighting for prestige or money. Maybe I'm too harsh with the book but it didn't touch me. It seemed as if there was a disconnect between the enormity of the dystopia and the responses of the characters. Somehow, the latter didn't feel convincing.\"\n",

I may have some opinions that are different from others, so just a warning.\\n\\nCharacters:\\n\\nI really liked Katniss's personality, and I love how she is portrayed in different situations. She also had some contrast to the other tributes and that subtly showed her differences rather than making it really obvious to others.\\n\\nPeeta is too soft. Katniss doesn't even need a guy in her life and she's perfectly capable of staying alive on her own. Peeta kind of brings her down and their relationship wasn't very good. I'm not saying I ship her with Gale though. I know some people agree with me, and I really like Katniss as her own person rather than her being represented because of a guy.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaymitch is a character that I really don't get what people like about. He's kind of annoying to me and isn't really anything special. I feel like all he does is limit Katniss and her abilities. If only he was written better.\\n\\nCinna is one of my favorites. He's so awesome and he shows Katniss so perfectly and stays with her.\\n\\nRue is so meaningful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI remember this to have a pretty consistent plot, and the pacing was okay.

It shouldn't be that big, and it was overly exaggerated.

And may the odds be ever in your favor.”\\nThoughts from re-reading The Hunger Games: a fight to the death among children is a great idea for a story, even if it was inspired/borrowed from Battle Royale. Katniss remains a complex, rather original heroine. And having a love triangle where the girl genuinely doesn’t undestand that she’s in a love triangle is a nice twist in a YA book (though, admittedly, a bit annoying and harder-to-believe after a while).\\n\\nBut has some flaws that stand out on a second reading. For a story about killing kids, our heroes get off pretty easy, killing only rarely and at societally approved times (mercy, defense of others). The choice to write the story solely from Katniss’s perspective omits other interesting pieces from the tale—most of the deaths, anything outside the arena (such as how the game makers and Snow are responding—scenes that were written for the movie). And the writing can be clunky in places, and occasionally unintentionally hilarious.\\n\\nStill, is a compelling story, and definitely worth reading if somehow you haven’t. Recommended.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"After two years of hearing that this book is a new classic and that I simply MUST read it, i have finally given it a chance. I even spent a week listening to a very passionate woman insist that books like the Harry Potter series and \\\"The Giver\\\" and \\\"The Handmaid's Tale\\\" would soon be forgotten as \\\"The Hunger Games\\\" becomes the new standard, not only for Young Adult Literature but for all dystopian literature. Believing such claims invariably leads to disappointment, so I didn't expect to be blown away; i simply expected \\\"The Hunger Games\\\" to be a good piece of fast-paced YA pulp.\\n\\nFive pages in, I was not merely unimpressed, but legitimately sick of this novel. One of my more moderate friends admitted \\\"Well, the writing isn't great, but the story is good. You have to stick with it.\\\" That was always a possibility, so I soldiered on, determined to give Collins a chance, and read all 374 pages. I even gave it a full day to simmer after finishing it. Alas, my initial impression stands, augmented and broadened by having read the other 369 pages: this is not a good book.\\n\\nThe protagonist is, i am given to understand, supposed to be a strong, independent young woman; but as with Vin in the \\\"Mistborn\\\" series, she actually feels flat and lifeless, like a cardboard cut-out of what the author thinks a character is supposed to be. A lot of authors make this mistake when writing what are supposed to be strong female leads, and it is certainly not a \\\"male authors only\\\" problem. So for every Sabriel (Garth Nix) or Aerin (Robin McKinley) or Tiffany Aching (Terry Pratchett) there is also a Vin or a Bella or a Katniss Everdeen. By comparison, the love interest in \\\"Brazil\\\" felt stronger and better developed.\\n\\nThe author's decision to write it in the first-person present-tense disconnects me from both the character and the narrative because the way she goes about it is so clumsy and irritatingly contrived. I actually believe i could excuse the terrible metaphors and the awful framing and the unnecessary sentence fragments if this were written in the past-tense as a sort of memoir; then all the errors and absurd word-choices and poor syntax could be written off as a product of the narrator herself. The choice of present tense eliminates that possibility however. Instead it seems to be a bizarre combination of inner-monologue and epistle, directed at someone outside of the author who requires explanations about things she or a resident of their world should already know, yet narrated as though it is a blow-by-blow account of what is happening to her right now.\\n\\nThings that struck me as I read this book:\\n\\n1) Everything that other reviewers have pointed out. For instance:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2) If she's from a poor, backwoods region with a single, largely-absentee parent and has suffered poor hygiene and repeated starvation...why aren't her teeth rotten? It may seem like a silly little quibble, but we're supposed to understand that her family can't even afford the most basic supplies and is reliant on her hunting and selling in the blackmarket, and yet she's kept her teeth healthy and shiny enough that her stylists in the Capitol have nothing to say about them during the extended makeover scene?\\n\\n3) Why are there apparently SO MANY predatory animals and so few prey animals? She speaks repeatedly about how dangerous it is to go beyond the fence due to the wild predators, but also talks about how time-consuming and arduous it is trying to find a prey animal -- prey animals, by the way, that have evidently rarely-if-ever seen a human. That's not how it works! But apparently in the world of this book, you have to search all day to even kill a squirrel, while wolves and bears and cougars are all thriving...despite being squashed between a chemical-ravaged wasteland and human settlements.\\n\\n4) Does this world follow Harry Potter/My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic rules by having people's fates defined by the names they're given at birth? Why else would the baker boy be named \\\"Peeta\\\" and the girl who becomes an archer be named after the Sagittaria flower and the woman in charge of athletic training be named \\\"Atala\\\" and the guy in charge of the (fire-related!) makeover be named \\\"Cinna\\\" and the majority of the people in the Capitol be named after Roman aristocrats? I am reminded of one of my favorite sequences on The Simpsons:\\n\\nCLETUS: We always figured someday Mary would marry. That's why we called her \\\"Mary.\\\" We name all our kids after what we think's gonna happen to 'em. Ain't that right, Stabbed-In-Jail?\\n\\nSTABBED-IN-JAIL: [whittling a spear] We'll see who stabs who!\\n\\n5) If the story had focused on the minor character \\\"Rue\\\" it would have been a far more interesting and compelling book. She was the only character that actually elicited anything resembling an emotional reaction from me.\\n\\n6) The first 100 pages of the book were immensely uneven, plodding inexplicably as though through molasses at points, then breezing past parts where more information would have been appreciated.\\n\\n7) Was the fey male stylist character REALLY necessary?\\n\\n8) Apparently the arena is some sort of domed, man-made ecosystem a la \\\"The Truman Show\\\" and the people running it have an almost god-like level of environmental control which they only exercise at convenient moments in the narrative, and the people of the Capitol now only use their amazing indistinguishable-from-magic command of genetic engineering to create mutations for the games. There are probably plausible explanations (rationalizations) for all of that, but it just felt entirely too convenient that these things were only mentioned or deployed at specific points in the narrative -- as though Collins had written herself into a corner or thought \\\"Ooh, this would be neat!\\\" and just threw in a hasty bit of exposition in an attempt to hand-wave it all away.\\n\\n9) Despite living in what amounts to the \\\"ghetto\\\" of an oppressive totalitarian state, and despite having no sources for history other than her state-mandated schooling, the protagonist somehow knows that the state is lying and covering up the true history of the very rebellion that led to her region being a \\\"ghetto\\\"? Riiiiiiiiiiiiight...\\n\\nOverall, the pace is uneven, the characters lack both depth and emotional resonance (especially the protagonist/narrator), the obligatory adolescent love-triangle feels forced and ham-fisted, and I get the feeling that the author has very little understanding of the natural world. Elements are mentioned, then forgotten or ignored (for instance, there are apparently numerous predatory animals in the \\\"arena\\\" but none of the combatants ever face them -- except for mutated ones at the end which are unleashed specifically for the climax -- and the normal predators are only ever seen in the scene with the fire). I'm told by reliable sources that the series gets better with later books, but I don't think that's a risk I'm willing to take after this one. The first book should suck you in -- this one spat me out.\\n\\nFor what it's worth though, it looks like they've made a genuinely compelling film out of this mediocre book!\"\n",

Now that I am older, I see a lot more of the commentary going on which I thought was very good.\\n\\nKatniss Everdeen volunteers to take part in the Hunger Games, a nation-wide 'sports' event where children from the Districts are chosen to battle to the death for the entertainment of the rich people in the Capitol. Throughout the novel she and her fellow District 12 tribute, Peeta Mellark, will try to battle it out, but as rules change over and over, and friends die winning and returning home starts getting more and more futile. Besides, if they do come home... at what cost will it be?\\n\\nThis is not meant to come across as 'hating on YA' (I love YA, do not worry), but I genuinely think that . I see the merits of this being more accessible to a wider audience, but there were a few moments that I really wish the age-range was not holding us back. I wish that we could really get into the nitty gritty and get really really dark, but again I understand that if this did happen, this book probably wouldn't have had such a wide reach as it did. That being said,\\n\\n\\n\\nI liked Peeta too, especially all the foreshadowing that happens around him and the build-up towards the romance. However, . She is a Hufflepuff through and through. I love how she does everything because of loyalty and love. The scene where Prim is picked is very gut-wrenching and the scene where\\ndies was better than I remembered. I UGLY cried. Both these scenes were excellent because they let Katniss shine. We see her heartbreak and compassion. I think that Collins wrote a character that I see influence future ones through and through.\\n\\nI must admit that I thoughts that . Maybe this is because I already knew what was going to happen, but I just thought that the pacing was either at 100% or 20%. That just really threw me. The middle section of Part II and the first half of Part III could have been shortened, and I think it would have made this more enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was honestly that was present throughout the book. When I read this for the first time five years ago, it all went over my head. Seeing how the citizens of the Capitol look at children killing each other, a barbaric deed one would think, as just another game show provides excellent commentary on how we accept terrible things because we are just used to them. We keep hearing stories about refugees, but few of us will actually go out of our way and try to make a difference. We will sit back and watch their conflicts play out, just like the people in the Capitol. When all these celebrities donate money to crises it is rarely \\\"look at this terrible thing that is happening\\\", but rather \\\"look how good I am helping this poor people\\\". Then their status is raised for a week and everyone moves on, but still no one cares about the issue at hand! We care so much about image, that some of us lose ourselves pretending to be people we just aren't. Especially with the rise of social-media. This latter theme is something that I thought was really interesting because of its relevancy right now.\\n\\nOverall, is unarguably a modern classic. Reading it now, I get a totally new perspective: I can focus more on the commentary and larger implications since I know the outcome of the games. , the sequel, was a masterpiece in past-me's eyes. I can't wait to see what new perspective I'll have on it now.\\n\\n-------------------------------\\n\\n#0 : ★★\\n#1 The Hunger Games: ★★★.25\\n#2 : ★★★★\\n#3 : ★★.75\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"This is my very first reread ever, and also my very first audiobook. I was expecting to enjoy it a lot more, but sadly the book didn't have that same effect on me the first time around.\\n\\nAlmost everyone knows what the Hunger Games is about. I don't see it necessary to discuss or give a short summary of it anymore. There are 100,000+ reviews on it already, and it has the highest number of ratings here on goodreads. In short, this is the most read book here on goodreads.\\n\\nThere is one reason why I chose to reread this. My favorite author is Stephen King, and the reason how that happened was because of this book. After reading this and the second book, the hype was not that prominent then, so I haven't heard much of the series from people. People were talking about other hyped up series, but I stumbled upon this accidentally. I had to research on people's reaction toward the third novel, and I saw this review that said I enjoyed the series a lot then, but that certain review made me curious on who this King guy was. I was 14 years old then, so I wasn't reading much adult/horror material then. After finishing Mockingjay, I decided to go ahead and try out The Long Walk (it was 2013 then, so I was 17), and I loved it. I ended up reading a lot more King novels and that resulted to me considering King as my favorite author. So in a way, this series introduced me to Stephen King, so I decided that I owed it a reread and a review at least.\\n\\nMy rating when I first read this was 4 stars, maybe even a 4.5, but my reading preference had change over the years. I'm not trying to be part of the minority here by hating on YA books, but almost all of the YAs I've read lately were terrible and shallow. This does not fall under the terrible and shallow pile, but it wasn't as good as it was before. The characters were still pretty decent, but I realized how the plot wasn't as violent anymore. Realistically speaking it is quite terrifying, but I realized that the execution was not. Rather than concentrating on the horrors of what the games can offer, Collins decided to build up the relationship of Katniss and Peeta. I'm not particularly fond of that, but I guess other teenagers are.\\n\\nI believe another factor that affected my rating would be the fact that I listened to this. I'm not a fan of audiobooks, that I can conclude. It might be because I didn't like the one who narrated this, but I think it's really audiobooks in general. The one who narrated this used a robotic voice that was fun at first, but got old quick. I might try out another audiobook and see if I'll change my opinion. I'm not going to listen to the second and third book anymore though.\\n\\n3.5/5 stars. It wasn't as awesome as it was before, but I guess it was still a good novel, and one of the good YA ones. If you're an avid YA reader and you haven't read this, then you're missing out on a lot. Everyone should at least give this one a try and see if they'll enjoy it or not.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"What can I say about this story that hasn’t already been said!?\\n\\nI was in two minds whether to read this or not. Mainly because I am not in the target age group of YA readers, partly because I have already seen the first movie, and partly because I’m not a big fan of dystopian novels. Still, the reader in me won and I went for it with fingers crossed. Surprisingly, no regrets at all! I quite enjoyed this book. If you think watching the movies is enough for this book, nope. The book is much better. (As almost always!)\\n\\nThe thing is, if the book is in first person pov from one of the Hunger Games participants, you can bet a million dollars that she's the one who will end up at least in the top three if not as the winner. So a fair bit of the premise is based on predictability. In every situation, Katniss has to come out on top. Even when her name was just in consideration as a tribute and it wasn't picked, you knew that she'll obviously get in somehow. So there's no suspense in terms of what will happen. The suspense is in how it will happen. For a book where it is easily possible to guess who the winner will be, can the author still keep you hooked till the end? Yes, she can! Even when you think things will turn out one way, the author still springs regular surprises at you, thereby making you eager to know what happens next.\\n\\nThe only minor complaint I had: There’s lots and lots of pondering over “what do I do”, one of the side-effects of having a first person narration for a book where the character is alone for a lot of time and hence we only get to hear her thoughts.\\n\\nNevertheless, this was an engrossing read. On to book two now! Katniss Everdeen is a memorable character and I’m eager to see where her life takes her after these Hunger Games. I’m all the more curious because I haven’t watched the rest of the HG movies. Let’s hope the sequels turn out to be as good, if not better.\\n\\n4.5 stars.\\n\\n***********************\\nJoin me on the Facebook group, , for more reviews, book-related discussions and fun.\"\n",

What I really liked about her was that she wasn't a complete moron like another female heroine of a YA literary phenomenon who shall remain nameless.

      "      \"review\": \"*****spoilers*****\\n\\nLike everyone else, I was drawn to the underdog of The Hunger Games. The unfairness of the games is probably the thing that bothered me the most, how some of the contestants were so much better prepared than others.\\n\\nLook, here you have a bunch of kids, yanked from their homes, sent to fight to the death. There is the underdog contestant. She had little chance of winning. And there's that other contestant who's by far the most qualified to win, and has basically been trained from birth, fully hard-ass enough to survive. This other character has such astonishing intuition that it is almost on par with Edward Cullen's mind reading skills (oddly though, except when something is completely obvious). Further, any moral dilemmas - such as having to kill friends - are taken care of by outside forces. And cornered? No problem, there'll be something handy within reach to solve the problem. Talk about born under a lucky star.\\n\\nSo yeah, things always worked out for Katniss.\\n\\nThen you have that other contestant who is far less lucky. Smaller, yet shrewd, observant, intelligent, able to replicate complicated patterns, at first able to avoid getting killed. Not attacking the others. Having no weapon skills, just hoping to survive by default. Her clever and risky idea at the Cornucopia worked so well that it brought on a fit of jealousy from Katniss - probably in the same mean spirit that inspired her to come up with the nickname \\\"Foxface\\\". Why not something less catty, say for example \\\"Vixen\\\" - which still plays on the fox reference yet also to female beauty and cleverness. Vixie for short, I should think.\\n\\nVixie never, ever called Katniss \\\"Arrowheadface\\\". Nor Peeta \\\"Doughface\\\".\\n\\nI felt the full weight of the evil of this contest when Vixie died so tragically and so very ironically. Her laughter, her unique abilities, her sleek red hair, gone, gone with a handful of berries. The mean trick fate played on her with those berries was so opposite to the luck that always went to Katniss. Here I felt the pain of living in a dystopia like Panem, where some are given advantages and others are not. My tears were flowing as I read Miss V's final moment: \\\"What’s left of Foxface’s emaciated body is lifted into the air. I can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight.\\\"\\n\\nAnd then later when attacked by the mutts, all Katniss can think of is “It’s her!” continuing her weird jealous obsession with the one girl that could've beaten her - if the games hadn't been so fixed in Katniss's favour.\\n\\nPoor poor, unlucky thing. No fantastic Mr. Fox for you, no Jamie, no D. H. Lawrence, dear Miss Vixie. No, life is not Fair & Balanced.\\n\\nI leave this for you.\"\n",

I like how this cruel political power is built and how it establishes its power in people with fear, with The Hunger Games. , how they have come to believe that what they do is right or why everyone agrees with it when the reality is that they force children to sacrifice themselves for their own fun.\\n\\n. Another factor that I really liked about the plot is the games themselves, in addition to the political factor that's very solid and very well thought out, and also seeing the personalities of all the other tributes, which although it's played very superficially still makes sense to me. Maybe I liked this aspect because in general, I like survival plots a lot so it was perfect for me.\\n\\n\\n\\n. First, we have, of course, , our brave and kind main character, I really like her, I think there's something admirable and captivating about her personality that sets her apart from the rest, , and I also think that her pov about the world where they live, although obviously full of resentment and anger, is very accurate and she's very mature for her age.\\nThen we have , and maybe this is an unpopular opinion, I don't know, but , even though he's Katniss' \\\"love interest\\\" and fellow tribute, doesn't have that impact that makes me worry about him or even makes me think about him, you know? feels quite secondary. I think that due to her soft personality he goes unnoticed in such a powerful plot.\\nOn the other hand, I have no opinion about yet, so maybe in my next reviews I'll talk more about him, for now, . seems adorable to me, I don't know why but I want to protect her every time she appears and OMG, is everything, I'll never get over her end. On the other hand, I like the characters of and because\\n\\n\\n. Also, I feel that I don't understand very well why all that resentment of Katniss towards Peeta t the beginning, I understand that a situation that happened when they were children united them in some way, but it doesn't make much sense to me. Katniss is angry and then she thinks she loves him and then Petta is angry and then they love each other ... I don't know, it's so unproductive for the plot.\\n\\n. The contrast between life in the districts and life in the Capitol is so enormous that it's shocking to see how life is so easy for some of them but so hard and sad for the poorest, it's heartbreaking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs expected, it was a lot of fun, so I'm happy to finally have decided to read the trilogy! I LOVE the concept of these books, I think it's one of the best dystopias out there & the plot is brilliant.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"“Remember, we're madly in love, so it's all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.”\\nGod, I forgot how much the movies did Peeta Mellark dirty.\\n\\nThis book is phenomenal. How can you possibly describe it as anything else? When it comes to Young Adult literature, the Hunger Games is the gold standard. Which is why a huge part of me didn’t even want to write a review. I mean, what can I possibly say that hasn’t been said hundreds of thousands of times? I’m not the best at articulating my thoughts, and I’m probably not going to add anything to the conversation, but I decided to re-read the series in preparation for A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and I feel compelled to say something about the series that was a formative, crucial part of my adolescence.\\n\\nI’m only going to say a little bit about the plot, the pacing, etc. because you can find out all about those aspects from hundreds of other reviewers, but I am going to talk about Peeta Mellark , which you probably guessed from the opening of this review. I just have a lot of feelings about him, okay?\\nBefore I go into my undying love and devotion for a fictional character (a normal Wednesday, am I right?), I’ve got to talk about something that bothered me so much when the movies came out: The Hunger Games cannot, and should not, be compared with other dystopian novels that came out in the years following the publication of the entire series. (Although, I’m not in anyway trashing these books or their authors. I’m as thirsty for Warner from Shatter Me as the rest of you.) I feel like most of those authors jumped on a trend that was in pretty high demand, and they tried to replicate in their stories what they thought made the Hunger Games so successful: a brash, ‘standoffish’ heroine, a huge war, and a love triangle. In doing so, though, a lot of these books ended up looking like cheap imitations, and they didn’t have the longevity or heart that came naturally to the Hunger Games.\\n\\nThis series is so much more than what the media shone a spotlight on; Suzanne Collins took issues like imperialism, war, PTSD, alcoholism, parentification, police brutality, and state-made propaganda and distilled them all in a way that made them accessible to adolescence without diminishing their severity and significance.\\n\\nI had quite a sheltered existence growing up (despite being raised on the brink of poverty), and this was my first real exposure to these issues, and I am so glad they were shown to me through a compassionate and empathetic lens. This series, I think, played a huge part in the formation of my political and moral identity. Around the time I was reading the last book, social media-led activism was starting to come into full force, and I’m acutely aware that I was drawn more towards the ‘rowdy, destructive’ activists than their detractors because the Hunger Games had taught me that authority does not equate to integrity. From there, my passion and for justice and activism has only grown, and I am hugely grateful to Suzanne Collins for laying the foundations of who I am today.\\nMy edition of the Hunger Games contains an interview with Suzanne Collins at the end that discusses the often-reviled (and poorly emulated) ‘love triangle’. I’m glad I took the time to read it after I’d finished my binge-reading because she put into words what I knew from the beginning: the love triangle serves a purpose higher than simple entertainment value, and that Peeta was the obvious (and inevitable) choice for Katniss. She talks to David Leviathan about how she views Peeta and Gale not as ‘two points on a love triangle, but as two perspectives on how war should be handled’. Gale, she says, tends towards ‘violent remedies’ when it comes to conflict; Peeta, on the other hands, sways more towards ‘diplomacy’. She tells us, ‘Katniss isn’t just deciding on a partner; she’s figuring out her worldview’.\\n\\nThis whole exchange made me so giddy because it cements something I’ve always known: Gale and Katniss aren’t compatible because of their difference in moral reasoning. We can see Suzanne Collins sprinkling the seeds of their discourse that ultimately comes into fruition at the end of Mockingjay as early as the first act of this book. When Gale goes to see Katniss in the Justice Building just before she’s carted off to the Capitol, he tells her, ‘how different can it be, really?’ when talking about hunting down and killing her fellow tributes. And he’s right: Katniss is extremely skilled with a bow, and if she’d wanted, she could have ended the games a lot earlier than she did once Glimmer was killed. But she didn’t. She doesn’t want to become a monster, and she doesn’t want to take the ‘violent remedies’ option that Gale favours. When she does kill in the first book, it’s only out of necessity or mercy. She even, towards the end of the novel, has to hide how the idea of how upset the notion of killing Thresh makes her.\\n\\nKatniss seems to lean more towards Peeta’s thoughts on the games: she doesn’t want them to change her, or to make her a pawn. This is one of the first cracks that occur between Katniss and Gale (and one of the first times you can see the similarities between Katniss and Peeta), and it ultimately culminates it the destruction of their friendship in the last book, and I think it’s pretty damn masterful that Suzanne Collins laid the foundations so early.\\n\\nI didn’t actually intend for that to become an essay, but I can’t get over the fact that people think Katniss and Gale are more compatible than Katniss and Peeta! I do, in part, blame the movies. They really filtered the whole ‘Katniss is choosing her identity as much as a partner’ from the narrative and made the whole thing a marketing ploy to sell hoodies with ‘team Peeta/team Gale’ on them in a complete rehash of Twilight (I had Team Edward hoodie, like any other ten-year-old with taste). There’s some irony in there somewhere...\\nI’m going to hone back onto my opening line because I’m brimming with the desperate need to talk about Peeta Mellark, who was done so dirty by the scriptwriters. I think Lionsgate knew that book!Peeta would have made Gale look irrelevant in comparison to his fantastic characterisation and witty one-liners, so they had to strip him of everything I loved about him and hire Liam Hemsworth to give Gale a chance.\\n\\nMy obvious bias aside, I honestly think Peeta is such an underrated character, and I have no idea why people prefer Gale over him (a thought which is cemented by my re-read). He’s whip-smart, cunning, and charismatic. Since I was thirteen, I’ve always loved the almost… edge? he has to him. Throughout the first book, both the reader and Katniss never know quite what to think of him, and there’s this air of almost mystery surrounding him which makes him compelling. He’s a great complement to Katniss because his survival instincts are based more on intelligence, shrewdness, and misdirection, which contrast her strength and agility. They make a fantastic team and both are them are permanently bound together by what they experienced in the Games. Peeta is by far my favourite character in the series, and I need someone to sarcastically and maddeningly call me sweetheart a few times, okay?\\n\\nSpeaking of Katniss Everdeen, I might be in the minority here, but I’ve never found her to be an unlikeable character. She’s intelligent, resourceful and – above all else – extremely loyal. Katniss is one of the more compelling Young Adult heroines in the genre, and I think her flaws (her stubbornness, inflexibility, and coldness) are what make her one of the more realistic ones, too. I don’t think any other character would have been capable of carrying one of the best Young Adult series in existence.\\nOverall, I don’t think any other Young Adult author has risen to the challenge Suzanne Collins set in 2008 when she set out to write a story that laid bare the horrors of war for a generation of teenagers who can’t remember Korea or Vietnam and the broken men and women they created. I am still, eight years later, unbelievable captivated by this series, and I hope I will be for years to come.\"\n",

And I think what stuck out the most this time around was just how clueless Katniss is about the fact that she's being set up as the figurehead of a revolution. Even Peeta knows more than she does! It also struck me just how efficient Collins is with her worldbuilding. There's no infodumping exposition. Instead, Katniss is just like \\\"Ugh, the Hunger Games are here again. Way to screw over the poor people and glorify death, government...\\\" and the reader knows exactly where they stand with the character and with the world. And it's BRILLIANT.\\n\\n4/12/2016\\nUm. I honestly don't know how I let so much time pass in between readings of this book. I was actually pretty reluctant to read this one again, given the current political situation. Plus, my reading expectations have changed a lot in the last almost-FIVE-YEARS WHAT THE EFF, so I honestly wasn't sure if I'd still see it as a five star book.\\n\\nFortunately, I do. Reading this five years on, the politics stands out to me so much more than it ever did. Cinna's manipulation of the system. Haymitch's fierce determination to make Katniss a symbol. Katniss' recognition of how sick it is that the people on her makeover team reminisce fondly about where they were at particular moments when various tributes died. Rue's innocent discussion of life in District 11. It's SUCH a political book, and it blows me away how sneakily the politics is woven into the story throughout.\\n\\nSo yeah. It's still a five star book.\\n\\n18/1/2012\\nI decided I needed to reread this in the lead up to the film being released. And I'm very glad I did. I got so much more from it than I did the first time around, when it was mostly just \\\"OMG, HAVE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, READ FASTER!!\\\".\\n\\nWithout giving away any details, there were numerous moments when I just wanted to shake Katniss and tell her to LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING PROPERLY. It sometimes seemed like she was standing back from it all, watching someone else walk around in her body. And there were numerous moments when it seemed like everyone but her had some kind of ability to see the future, and knew what she was going to become. I'll be interested to see if they include that sense in the film.\\n\\n2/10/2011\\nI was slightly sceptical about this, given that everyone was raving about it. The last time that happened, it was over the Twilight series, which is one of the worst pieces of crap I've ever had the misfortune to read. This, on the other hand, I really enjoyed. And am now very much looking forward to the movie coming out! I'll definitely have to track down the other books in the series, because I really want to know what happens next.\"\n",

They're soooo depressing and they seem to rarely end well. Soylent Green is made of people! I even hated The Giver. Yeah, that's right. I said it. I know, everyone looooves that book. Except me...and probably every kid in eighth grade who had to write a report on it. So there. Nayh. Anyway, my point is that I can't stand to read depressing stories about some bleak future looming on the horizon. I did not want to read Hunger Games.\\nHowever, I have a goodreads friend, who shall remain nameless (cough) DORSI (cough), who has been basically pestering me for close to a year now to read this thing. She drove me nuts with it. Every comment she left me ended with a variation on the phrase, 'Have you read Hunger Games yet?'. Honestly, I considered de-friending her, but I was afraid she'd just hunt me down and show up at my door with a copy of this book in her hand. Ok, I'm kidding. Sort of.\\nAt any rate, I thought after a while she would give up on me as a lost cause, but noooooo. Like a rabid dog with a bone, she just wouldn't let it go. A few weeks ago, she finally snared me in her net. \\\"So, it's been a while. Have you had a chance to read Hunger Games?\\\". Gah! This time I had no defense. I was running low on new ideas for reading material, and in my paranoid state of mind...I was sure she knew it! She had me cornered. I could see that the year I spent skillfully tap dancing around her requests had all been for nothing. There was no escape. I felt the cold chill of defeat sink into my bones.\\n\\nSo I read the book.\\n\\n(Pretty anticlimactic, huh? Yeah. I thought so, too.)\\n\\nNow comes the hard part. I have to apologize to my nameless friend.\\nAhem. (deep breath in...deep breath out)\\nDorsi...er, Nameless Friend, you were right and I was wrong. Hunger Games is a really good book. You are not a crazy person, and I am glad you shoved this book down my throat. The fact that I hate the entire genre and still ended up giving it 4 stars means that you have excellent taste.

And you've probably already read all of what I have to say before, but I've decided to write this review anyway.\\n\\nThe first person view really allows the reader to connect to Katniss as a character, which I think is really well done. It's great to read that she doesn't always have all the answers, and her flaws make her a much more interesting character. She has just the right amount of emotion, not too soppy and not like a robot. Every single character in the novel was well developed and completely unique. Even minor characters such as the stylists were described well and distinguished between, which was exceptionally done. There are always people to provide humour, or a voice of reason when it's needed and the personalities were well balanced.\\n\\nI really loved the settings. District 12, the capitol and the arena are all brilliantly unique and fit well with the storyline. My main issue (really only minor) was that I thought sometimes the descriptions were unclear. I would have the setting pictured one way in my head, but suddenly there would be a pond that I would have to factor in which I couldn't recall. I never really understood the size of the arena, and whilst the settings were magnificent, I wish there were more descriptions of them to show off what wonderful surroundings Collins had invented.\\n\\nI don't think there were any really crazy plot twists, but I was still on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what happened next. Even though I've now read it multiple times, I still eagerly anticipate every page. I won't spoil it, but the book was concluded satisfactorily so that you're not dying whilst you wait (if you have to) for the next one, but it also leaves many plot points for the next book. The sequel is very well set up. I really loved this book. It was excellently written with a great plot and great characters. Overall, it was a nice, fast-paced read and I would definitely recommend it.\"\n",

I fell completely into this world and felt deeply for Katniss, our prickly, determined huntress and sweet, loving Peeta.\\n\\nRereading I can see this isn't perfect - a lot of the wider action is glossed over, with little time spent with any of the other district players (most of them don't even have names) meaning I didn't care about their deaths, and the plot steamrollers towards the finale without much time for reflection, but it was interesting to see the way Katniss and the Capitol each manipulate the other. Katniss is constantly thinking about how she appears to the viewers, putting on smiles and refusing to cry to show she isn't weak. We don't get this insight from the films, and I admit I'd forgotten how clever Katniss is for doing this. She knows how to play their games. Peeta by comparison is just bumbling through life relying on this deep love for a woman who think he's the best player in the game. It's actually quite fascinating.\\n\\nI owe Suzanne Collins a lot, because she reintroduced a lot of readers to YA and helped to reformulate the genre. The amount of YA dystopia I read after this came out is unreal, but nothing will top this for me.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I think, really, that the mark of a formative book is if you can remember where you first read it. I can name a few books that I distinctly remember the where and when of reading, and no book for me inspires that feeling stronger than The Hunger Games.\\nTake One:\\nYou're a middle schooler, maybe in sixth grade, and are browsing the school library. There's a section roped off that's only for the older kids, and that's where you see The Hunger Games. You know about The Hunger Games, of course. One of the Mockingjay movies has just been released. You bought your mother Catching Fire and Mockingjay from the school book fair. You know that The Hunger Games is a book that you are Not Supposed To Read because it's \\\"disturbing\\\". But one day, instead of going outside for recess, you poke into the library. This, of course, is not unusual. You do this during recess, before school (since you, in this period of your life, arrive to school on time), and after. You sometimes even do so during class when you can, not that your teachers care. And so you grab this book from the shelf and sit cross-legged on the floor, and flip it open, right to a scene where a girl's flesh is being swelled and dissolved by bee venom, and think that maybe your mother was right. You put the book back, shaken yet not fully deterred, and check out Turtle In Paradise for the fifth time instead.\\nTake Two:\\nYou are here again, in another library. It's summer break, and you're camping out in a closed school library while your mother works. It's hot out and the air conditioning is off, and the entire place smells like fish. You're older now, going into 8th grade, and think you're more mature than you are--after all, that's what people tell you, that you're \\\"mature for your age\\\". It's a polite way of saying you're pretentious. Your school year saw your first musical, and--more importantly--your biggest success to date, awards you hadn't even dreamed of earning. So, of course, you found the summer utterly boring. Summer afternoons, anyways. You're looking at the chapter books, and they're all familiar to you, the likes of Harry Potter and Divergent. But then you see it, a black hardcover with a golden bird. It's not squirreled away at this library, oddly. You pick it up, absentmindedly flipping it open. You read about false kisses, skulls bashed in with rocks, lamb-and-plum stew, and decides after a few pages that you are in love.\\nTake Three:\\nIt is the same year, just August as opposed to July. You have been hounding your mother about reading the book, complaining about how you want to read it for the library's summer reading program but the only copy is in Spanish. Your mother relents, and says that you can read it in eighth grade, once it officially starts. And then you're all driving up to see your grandparents, and visiting various little thrift shops and garage sales with them. You go to a Salvation Army--one which no longer is, and is instead just an empty building--and browse the books. You already \\\"borrowed\\\" your grandmother's library card to check out a copy of The Penderwicks at Point Mouette, and were disappointed that even this library a state away had their copies of The Hunger Games checked out. Salvation Army's books are hit or miss, usually either old or obscure, but then you see it: a paperback Scholastic edition of The Hunger Games. The spine uncracked, the scent untainted (though it would soon smell faintly of cigarette smoke, like most things you would leave laying out at your grandparents' house), and the pages unbent. It was this moment that sparked a half-joke you'd reuse for years to come: \\\"is it a resale shop if you can't buy at least half of the Twilight saga and Hunger Games books?\\\". (You would later add DVDs of Chicago to the joke.) You picked the book up and brought it to your mother, a wide smile on your face. You mother relented, and you started the book in the car. While your family swam, you read The Hunger Games on the basement couch. You read it in an enchanted blur, the words pulling you through the book like a fish on a lure. As soon as you surface from it, you start it again. The book enraptures you in a way few others do, and certainly few did then. You had not yet read Frankenstein, The Catcher in the Rye, Finishing the Hat, Watchmen, The Diviners, any of the books you usually name as her favorite. While you had always been a reader and had never really stopped, this book--this one little paperback--brought you to reading young adult. It remains a favorite book to this day, one you bother people into reading and one you have never forgotten, and will never forget. It gave you a steady figure to look to in tumultuous times; someone you so associated with your own hope for the future that you caught yourself pinning a mockingjay to your jacket as the capitol was raided, if only to remember that no matter how bleak the world seemed in that moment, there was always that glimmer of hope.\\n\\nAnyways that was pretentious as , but I figured it was the only way to say something about The Hunger Games that hadn't already been said. It's tied with The Diviners as my favorite series period, and remains one of my favorite books to this very day. May the odds be ever in your favor.\"\n",

The fight for survival, not only that the other tributes are your enemy, but it also you against the hunger, thirst, the game makers and vicious creatures. How Katniss survives because of her hunting abilities and that Rue allied with her. It's detailed, the herbs, the hunting for food, the weapons and that's make it more realistic for me.\\n\\nIt also has plot twists that I never see coming. It has drama, action, romance and comedy so I think it will appeal to a lot of readers out there.

Each year one boy and one girl between 12 and 18 from each of the 12 districts are selected by lottery to represent their district in the Hunger Games; a televised fight to the death competition. Teenagers in this age range and trade extra entries (outside of the requirement) into the lottery for food and Katniss has done this for her family ever since she was eligible, so going into this years lottery she knows her chance of being drawn is high. But it's also her little sister Prim's first time being eligible but with only one entry her chances of being drawn are slim. However, as the community braces for the drawing it's not Katniss' own name that she hears but her little sister's, which is even worse. Without another option Katniss' volunteers to go in Prims place.\\n\\nOnce they arrive at the Capitol they spend a week getting ready, training and doing interviews before being injected with tracking devices and thrust into the game. As time progresses and surviving gets harder, Katniss makes enemies and allies but in the end there can only be one victor.

But I was always active in sports, encouraged to balance my time, to not be a total recluse-And I will always thank my parents for that. But now that I am older and can read before bed as I please with my bank account to manage, I find that I read more than I even watch tv or even shop-which I also love doing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut for a while, life was more important-Sports, schoolwork, getting into college, finding my now husband.....and while I read, it was more like the common population was. I got to read, but didn't get to flourish. And then my best friend (ex Best Friend now) in college MADE me read THG. My argument was, '?' The barbarics of it astounded me and the inhumanity it must have taken to write it (or so I thought) appalled me. But then I picked it up-begrudgingly-and my world was flipped on it's axis. . I read this series in a week-two or three days, to be exact-and I couldn't be bothered with life, my husband, or ANYONE. And then, because it literally , I read it two weeks later-in full-again. I. Could. Not. Think. About. Anything else. Because how could a book about the be this good??\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut that's where I was . This book is so much deeper than death-it's about , it's about doing everything you can to , to save your family and those you care about. It's about love and compassion and the question of humanity and what you are willing to do to survive and keep those you care about out of harm's way. . A . that no one saw coming....Katniss fucking Everdeen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis book, even after having read it three times, was just as good as in 2012. I still laughed. I still cried. I still . The feels haven't went anywhere and there are still scenes that the movie couldn't capture or touch with a ten foot pole (Even though I do love the movies). The cave scene. The creek scene. The 'hunting as a pair' scene. Even the end couldn't hold as much weight as the book. And for those of you who have only seen the movies, yeah, it's amazing. Best book to movie adaption ever, in my opinion (all of them thus far, especially 2). But...I can't help . You will know the deep attachments that were formed and just how much depth there is to such a simple story. And...sorry. I feel sorry for you. So, no, I couldn't write something, because this series is everything to me and why I read like a lunatic now, always looking for my next fix that will make me feel like this again.

      "      \"review\": \"February 2025:\\n\\n\\n\\nMay 2020: I think what I want to talk about on this my third reading of The Hunger Games is why I think it was a breakout bestseller, and why all the books that tried to copy it and profit off of YA \\\"dystopia\\\" as a genre in its wake got it wrong. Hint: they went for the surface level and completely ignored what actually makes this book great. Another hint: It's not actually the fact that it's a dystopia. Anyone can do that and it doesn't mean it will be good. In fact it will be mostly be derivative and bad if that's what you're going for.\\n\\nFirstly, I think this book works because Collins didn't set out to write a dystopian YA novel with a super special heroine. She's said in interviews that her inspiration came from watching the horrorshow of reality TV in America and then her mind extrapolated the rest. I feel like that kernel of realness provides a basis for this fictional world that gives it a real depth.\\n\\nKatniss *isn't* a super special heroine. That's mostly what I want to talk about in this review actually. She is so incredibly flawed, and she basically wins the day by having years of knowledge and training under her belt, plus the personality of a fighter, and a willingness to ally herself with people others deem weak. It's easy to forget about all of the non-pretty parts of Katniss in the wake of her accomplishments.\\n\\nShe basically spends the entire three books being traumatized and re-traumatized and living with PTSD. Even before that she is closed off emotionally, even with the only two people in the world she says she loves (Prim and Gale). She's in survival mode, and hasn't managed to make it beyond that to experience other emotions. Her mind is entirely taken up with finding food for her family, and living through life first in District 12, and then the games (and eventually the rebellion). So much of the conversation around these books was stuff that had nothing to do with anything Katniss actually cared about. The Peeta vs. Gale debate was mostly irrelevant, because all it did was show the preferences of the person talking about it. Mostly it didn't take into account the fact that Katniss openly says and thinks multiple times, in this book alone, that she doesn't want to get married or be with someone, and that she doesn't want kids. This is not a story about happily ever after, girl getting boy. This is a story about living with and through trauma, about systems that dehumanize, and the people who willingly participate in those systems, and what it does to you if you refuse.\\n\\nSo anyway I will probably get back on my soapbox tomorrow also after I finish the second book, which I plan to do. I basically did this re-read in about four hours right before bed last night, and when I woke up first thing this morning. I'll probably finish the series out by Monday.\\n\\nI put off and put off the re-read of this series for as long as I could, but I finally gave in. I picked it up, read the first paragraph, and before I knew it I was accidentally fifty pages in, so I was just like, okay, fuck it: this is my Saturday (and Sunday and Monday for books two and three, as it turns out).\\n\\nIt’s funny how when you’re a a part of an online community how different pop culture can feel, and how things can trend with a certain group of people. Everything feels more personal. The online circles I tend to frequent are full of smart, geeky, enthusiastic wonderful people, and in those circles shit like – intelligent thrill rides that you can finish off (or rather, that you HAVE to finish off) in a single sitting – tends to flourish. Unfortunately, that also means I have little beyond my own thoughts and experiences to add to the discussion. This book might just be . Plus, with the release of the film, it’s fever out there.\\n\\nI do have some things to say about reading this book for the second time, which was a much different experience than reading it for the first time. It’s the true test of a good book if it’s still enjoyable the second go-round even though you know what’s going to happen, and the series definitely holds up (I will even venture to say that it was better on re-read for me).\\n\\nI had some issues with the writing the first time through, but because I’ve now spent so much time with these characters and this story, and I love them now, that was much less important to me this time. This time around it was less about what’s going to happen next and more about watching how this thing sets up the next thing, or how this other thing is paid off later, or how this other other thing reads completely different now that I know how that thing over there turns out. The narrative makes even more sense in retrospect, as does Katniss. Especially after the glut of YA dystopian/romances I’ve subjected myself to since reading this book for the first time, I really appreciate the Katniss of it all. Her particular brand of individual personhood is refreshing. She struggles with her feelings, and she doesn’t act like a typical character in a dystopian romance, bland and non-specific. She is three dimensional and has a definite personality, one that is wonderfully grating at times.\\n\\nActually, I think the love triangle gets too much play out here in the real world. This book is not about a love triangle; that’s just a secondary thing. Katniss’s love life is secondary, maybe even tertiary, both to the narrative and to her as a character. Obviously, her fake “love life” put on by the cameras is very much in the foreground, but in those moments we’re inside of Katniss’s head, it’s almost never about love. It’s about survival, and playing the game. Any real feelings she develops for Peeta or discovers about Gale are so muted and confused for her that she can’t even begin to sort them out until is over for good. This is a war story, a story about how greed and spectacle are used to anesthetize the masses and keep the status quo, and sure it’s got love in it, maybe even as driving force, but not the kind of love that makes teenagers ask each other if they’re Team Peeta or Team Gale.\\n\\nWhat surprised me the most about re-reading this book is how completely absorbing this story still is, despite having read it before, and despite having just seen the movie. It was just as un-put-downable as the first time I read it, and because I’ve internalized it, the story feels like it’s mine now. So yeah, I’m adding a star to my previous four star rating. I think the book has earned it.\\n\\nI read this thing in two hours flat, not counting a couple pee breaks and the ten minutes it took to make breakfast in the morning. I was in fact really close to giving it five stars, but something held me back. It's not that there's anything necessarily with anything that's there in the text, just that I think Collins could have added a little extra oomph, a little more subtext, you know. But it definitely lives up to the hype.\\n\\nLet's just say that I liked it enough that I want to own it now. In hardcover.\"\n",

Well written, with excellent world-building, an engaging main character and a terrific plot. It is tough to do a dystopian world well, especially in a YA setting, and the author does a superb job in making the background dark enough to grab you by the throat without letting it completely overwhelm the narrative. After finishing the book, I was defintely left with the desire to learn more about the world and the characters. Just what you want at the beginning of a trilogy. Highly Recommended!!!!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"A few years ago, I saw the film adaptation of The Hunger Games, and disliked it very much. The ending, especially. Not only is it a cop-out, I think its cheapens its potential.\\nNeedless to say, this didn't compel me to rush out to the local book store or library any time soon. And it was with extreme reluctance that I finally gave the novel a shot. I'm glad I did.\\n\\n\\ndystopian, YA tale is about much more than its engaging and highly addictive plot. It's merely the beginning of Katniss Everdeen's journey of self-discovery, of love, the consequences of her actions and by the end, I want to think she's on the verge of questioning why she makes the choices that she does.\\nI'm still not sure that I like her, as I have no clear sense of who she is, on a personal level. I do admire some of her qualities, I even sympathize and can relate to her...to a degree. I just want to know more, I want to delve deep into her psyche, analyzing and then basking in her memories, both benign, indifferent, and malevolent. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but these are some of things I look for while reading. I to know the character's intimately, and to watch them mature and grow. And she does, to a point, but I feel a disconnect between her actions and words. To quote the incomparable George R.R. Martin, \\\"Words are wind.\\\" Actions are everything, and hers show a weakness in some ways, and strength in others. She's too temperamental.\\n\\n\\nBut more than that, I fell in love with the history of Panem. For that reason alone, I don't regret reading this. After all, there are many gems not seen in the film, like the significance of the mockingjay, and the tender associations that Katniss associates with it and her father. The history fascinated me. I'm really hoping to learn more as the trilogy progresses. In all earnestness, Collins could write am entire novel-length book depicting the details of the country's uprise, the rebellion\\nand all it entails, and I'd probably love it.\\n\\nShe writes of an oppressed society where stealing is punishable by death and suicide's almost a virtue. Of finding yourself and one's self-worth in this ever changing and complex world. Ultimately, it's about all these things, and more. Refuse to stay silent. Defy your oppressor.\\n\\nThere are a few passages which really resonate, like the \\\"bread scene.\\\" The following awed me, and could potentially be the inspiration of a story, assuming I choose to pursue something similar:\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's writing like this that leads me to believe that could have been better. And suspect much more from her in the future. If she had polished this manuscript a bit more, complete with the omission of needless words, including all those annying cliche's, with an emphasis on clarity, I believe she could have transformed it from good to great.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough the basis premise of her trilogy isn't original (reminiscent of ) I appreciate the fact that Collins explores the effects of war, and the increasingly violent realities of television. So-called \\\"Reality Tv\\\" especially. It's scary to think about the world reveling in death as entertainment, but isn't that we're doing? Not to the extent seen here or in King's novella, but look at how explicit television shows have become, and we-as a viewing audience-- allow them to thrive. The media sells death on a daily basis, as well as all forms of negativity, and we're all too happy to oblige.\\n\\n\\nThe ending. I now understand and appreciate the reasons behind it, but I don't have to like it. I still hate it, and I doubt I'll ever like it. Worse yet, the novel goes another thirty pages after the Games denouement, making it anti-climatic, and not a whole lot was gained.\\n\\n\\nI have it on good authority (thanks again, Book-sister) that things pick up in the second book, that the crap starts to hit the fan, so I'll give a reluctant go..eventually.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"You know the term \\\"helicopter parent\\\"? I'm a helicopter reader. I am ridiculously protective of my books and the characters that come to life through them. Film adaptations always make me nervous because empirical data suggests a high rate of illiteracy amongst Hollywood executives. When I found out The Hunger Games, or MY FAVORITE SERIES, was getting adapted to the big screen, I put on my aviator cap and goggles and started hovering. I had already mentally cast my Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch, and Cinna, so I was obsessed with any and all casting news and how the real cast matched up to my mental cast. Aside from Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, EVERYONE else made me nervous. Miley Cyrus's boyfriend? Gale would never! Woody Harrelson?? Haymitch is a drunk, not a stoner! Josh Hutcherson? His name is longer than he is! Lenny Kravitz? Being married to Denise Huxtable does not an actor make! I analyzed every trailer and tried to tamp down my expectations. I decided to re-read the books instead so the story would be fresh in my mind for the premiere -- because obviously I was going to a midnight showing.\\n\\nI really liked the movie, but the standouts were undoubtedly Katniss, Cinna, Rue, and Prim. Those actors nailed their roles. They exceeded every expectation and brought these characters to life as Suzanne Collins wrote. Lenny Kravitz WAS Cinna. Rue and Prim were even more impressive, not only because they're so young, but also because they're the emotional centers -- Prim is Katniss's heart in District 12 and Rue is Katniss's heart in the Arena. Amandla Stenberg and Willow Shields had more of a performance burden on them than, say, Liam Hemsworth because if they didn't deliver, it would've undermined Katniss's journey. At least, that's how I saw it. But those girls, those actors, delivered. I had to stop myself from bawling at the Reaping and bawling during scene in the Games. I can't even imagine the emotional and professional high those girls feel right now, knowing all the pressure that was on them from crazy helicopter fans like myself.\\n\\nAnd then I saw on Jezebel. Disgusted doesn't even cover it. Pissed isn't strong enough. When I saw , \\\"#spreadlove\\\", I just got so sad that this 13, THIRTEEN year old girl had to be subject to this when she should be ecstatic. Since I don't condone meeting stupidity and ignorance with violence, let's have a chat. People who don't agree with Amandla Stenberg's casting but claim to be fans of the book: let's talk reader to reader. WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU READ?? What part of \\\"dark brown skin\\\" is difficult to understand, imagine, and see? I'm truly flummoxed. If you missed the description the first time around or it went over your head, I urge you to read the book again. You're not only missing the words, you're missing the point.\"\n",

When I wasn't thinking about it I was asleep. Even then the book crept into my mind at times.\\nAt the beginning I was very hesitant to finish the book. Not because I didn't like it, but because it's part of a series. This one being the only one out at the moment. My sister warned me that the end is a bit of a cliffhanger, and I was sure that I'd be ripping my hairs out wanting to know how the series ended NOW! It's worth it though. The premise of the book made me dubious at first also. I mean, kids who are forced to kill each other until there's only one left standing doesn't sound like a nice read. The gore wasn't half as bad as I'd anticipated (maybe because I used to watch crime shows).\\nAll the characters had so much depth that while you're reading it feels like they're completely real. As I read in another review, Katniss is both strong and resourceful, but naive at the same time. Katniss' feelings were so palpable that it was like the book actually had a heart beat. It could be that I could understand her feelings because I have siblings, but there is absolutely nothing else in which I could relate to Katniss, so I believe it's the writing that captures her voice and feelings so well. Obviously I'm planning on reading the rest of the series.\\nI don't want to give too much away, but the only reason why I knocked off a half star was because I wished Katniss would've seen what I thought was obvious. Also, I HATE love triangles (this is usually a deal-breaker for me). Nothing good comes of love triangles. Why do people do this? WHY?!? It also peeved me how it played out in the end, but I guess if it all worked out perfect then there would be no need to read the other books. I'm hooked.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Well, what a gripping and terrifying series to come.\\n\\nMany of you know the story of the Hunger Games, its became very well known and loved/hated by many. But to me, it's worth the hype and it's worth reading the books and watching the movies\\n\\nKatniss Everdeen is an interesting character, but she can be very childish in her actions, and can be very stubborn when she wants to. She's also very annoying and problematic to all. But it's also the reason why I like her, despite her maturity, she is still a teenager and her emotions reflect what a 16 year old girl will act. In a way, I'm glad Colins kept her this way. I reckon it will show her growth and development more as the series unfolds\\n\\nI also like her spirit, her protectiveness and her willingness to do what she must to protect her loved ones and to try and do the best she can for all.\\n\\nBut my favourite character is Peeta, his gentleness and his willingness to protect his loved ones too. But Peeta is more mature and fierce than Katniss to a certain degree.\\nAnd even though not everything he wants or plans goes exactly the he thought, he doesn't give up and continues on. I like his determination.\\n\\nGale, is somewhat of a mystery here, since its main focus is on Katniss and Peeta but I enjoyed reading about his life through Katniss' thoughts, like the first time they met and how they survived together by hunting. It gave Gale much more perspective on his life and for District 12\\n\\nHaymitch and Effie are fun to watch, how drunk Haymitch and how optimistic Effie is as well.\\n\\nKatniss' and Peeta's prep team are also fun to read about, how much they love their fashion and makeup. But of course out of all, I enjoy the simplicity and honesty of Cinna. He doesn't try to be arrogant or over the top on his fashion, but he also doesn't criticise those who does. I can understand why Katniss would be friends with him from the start, out of everyone in the Capitol he seems the one who is more human.\\n\\nReading about how one boy and girl from every 12 districts have to fight to the death in the arena the Gamemakers create, its brutal, it's graphic and even more horrifying than what you see in the movies. But it a ride you don't want to miss.\\n\\nSo if you've seen the movies, do yourself a favour and read the books! They are just as good, even better since there are many important moments that we don't see on screen.\\nBut if you've only read the books, go on and watch the movies! You won't be disappointed I promise you, it's just as good as the book. But of course the books are better ;)\\n\\nHighly recommend it!\\n\\nAlso thank you to and for buddy reading this with me! It was fun reading and discussing this with you!\\n\\nLet book 2 begin!\"\n",

I got caught up in it and recommend it highly.\\n\\nBut there are a couple of problems. The heroine is sadly rather dense for someone so smart. You'll spend a lot of time shaking your head. I won't say more as that would entail a spoiler or spoilers, so....\\n\\nI finally settled on a four star rating because of a few glitches that just drove me crazy. For example,the protagonist standing giving a blow by blow account of someone being killed until the killer turns on her. You're wondering Why the h*** aren't you already twenty yards away. The character has stayed in one place for no good reason leading to her being in very bad spot when she could have taken to her heels during the other fight(assuming she wasn't going to take part when it would have been more advantageous for her of course). There were several places where I wanted to put my head through a wall in frustration asking \\\"why aren't you...\\\" or \\\"why are you ...\\\" . A few times it was like watching a character in a \\\"dead teenager movie\\\" go to the basement \\\"armed\\\" with only a flash-light to investigate the \\\"strange noise\\\" when they know the slasher has already killed three of his/her friends.\\n\\nBut that was only a few times...on the whole this is a wonderful read. I had a library copy, but went out and bought a copy of this and the next volume.\\n\\n\\nRecommended.\\n\\nUpdate: Unfortunately things didn't pan out and I was very disappointed in the third volume of this series. That's sad, because the first (this one) was excellent and the second one good. But it's a trilogy and the failure of the third pulls down the entire set.\\n\\nI sold all 3.\"\n",

I found it trite, slow-moving, predictable, not written that well, and completely unrealistic. I didn't like any of the characters. The heroine is judgmental and self-righteous. The plot has been done much better most notably The Long Walk by Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman.\\n\\nBeing a mom, I would fight to the death for my children (and I didn't give birth to them--I hear biological parents have even stronger bonds) and almost every mom I know is the same. To protect our young is our most basic animal instinct. (I'm a foster parent so I know there are some that wouldn't but it's actually quite rare--most believe they are doing what is best for their children when the kids are with them. Most parents fight for their kids in court no matter how bad they are at parenting.) I believe there would be mass rebellion rather than put up with this murderous game let alone make it entertaining. Plus, these are descendants of Americans, who culturally believe in rebellion and go to war at the drop of a hat, and it's not far enough in the future for that to have been beaten out of these people. I think this story would be absurd in most cultures but Americans have been indoctrinated into a culture of rebellion since the birth of the country.\\n\\nThe book might be entertaining for some but for me, it's completely ridiculous.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"MY REVIEW\\nThe story is set in an time when the country is divided into districts and each year a girl and boy is selected 2 from each district to compete in a game of survival pitted against each other until only one winner remains that's 24 contestants.\\nFrom district 12 is Katniss Everdeen a girl who lives in the seam, hunts in the woods trades in the Hob. She's going into the death game.\\nBefore the game of death all she new was survival and hunger. This a good page turner for all ages well written, you really feel you're there in the moment rooting for this young skilled girl and her fellow contestants.\\n\\nLet the games begin!\\n\\nSeptember 12, 2008 Stephen King talks of The Hunger Games\\n\\nStephen King finds a new YA novel as scarily addictive as his favorite arcade game.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games\\n\\nAs negative Utopias go, Suzanne Collins has created a dilly. The United States is gone. North America has become Panem, a TV-dominated dictatorship run from a city called the Capitol. The rest of Panem is divided into 12 Districts (the former 13th had the bad judgment to revolt and no longer exists). The yearly highlight in this nightmare world is the Hunger Games, a bloodthirsty reality TV show in which 24 teenagers chosen by lottery two from each District fight each other in a desolate environment called the ''arena.'' The winner gets a life of ease; the losers get death. The only ''unspoken rule'' is that you can't eat the dead contestants. Let's see the makers of the movie version try to get a PG-13 on this baby.\\n\\nOur heroine is Katniss Everdeen (lame name, cool kid), a resident of District 12, which used to be Appalachia. She lives in a desperately poor mining community called the Seam, and when her little sister's name is chosen as one of the contestants in the upcoming Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. A gutsy decision, given the fact that District 12 hasn't produced a Hunger Games winner in 30 years or so, making them the Chicago Cubs of the postapocalypse world. Complicating her already desperate situation is her growing affection for the other District 12 contestant, a clueless baker's son named Peeta Mellark. Further complicating her situation is her sorta-crush on her 18-year-old hunting partner, Gale. Gale isn't clueless; Gale is smoldering. Says so right on page 14.\\n\\nThe love triangle is fairly standard teen-read stuff; what 16-year-old girl wouldn't like to have two interesting guys to choose from? The rest of The Hunger Games, however, is a violent, jarring speed-rap of a novel that generates nearly constant suspense and may also generate a fair amount of controversy. I couldn't stop reading, and once I got over the main character's name (Gale calls her Catnip ugh), I got to like her a lot. And although ''young adult novel'' is a dumbbell term I put right up there with ''jumbo shrimp'' and ''airline food'' in the oxymoron sweepstakes, how many novels so categorized feature one character stung to death by monster wasps and another more or less eaten alive by mutant werewolves? I say more or less because Katniss, a bow-and-arrow Annie Oakley, puts the poor kid out of his misery before the werewolves can get to the prime cuts.\\n\\nCollins is an efficient no-nonsense prose stylist with a pleasantly dry sense of humor. Reading The Hunger Games is as addictive (and as violently simple) as playing one of those shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway. Balancing off the efficiency are displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults. When Katniss needs burn cream or medicine for Peeta, whom she more or less babysits during the second half of the book, the stuff floats down from the sky on silver parachutes. And although the bloody action in the arena is televised by multiple cameras, Collins never mentions Katniss seeing one. Also, readers of Battle Royale (by Koushun Takami), The Running Man, or The Long Walk (those latter two by some guy named Bachman) will quickly realize they have visited these TV badlands before.\\n\\nBut since this is the first novel of a projected trilogy, it seems to me that the essential question is whether or not readers will care enough to stick around and find out what comes next for Katniss. I know I will. But then, I also have a habit of playing Time Crisis until all my quarters are gone. B --Entertainment Weekly(Stephen King)\\n\\n\\nAuthor interviews video and trailers here ..\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"First Review\\n\\nI believe the time has come for me to construct a proper review of this work. I'll be honest and admit that the brilliant film inspired me to do so. I'm not ashamed of the fact that I'm a bibliophile and love a good movie adaptation. So hang onto your hats as I explain why I love The Hunger Games series...\\n\\nMy personal opinion as mentioned before is that there is always something special about the first novel in any series. No matter how trashy it may appear. And if I see that glimmer I will read on and see if things improve in the later books. Fortunately things did not need to improve as this magical work was brilliant on its own.\\n\\nI think part of the appeal of The Hunger Games is the fact that Suzanne Collins made some smart decisions in the plot twists and developments of her world. the choice to narrate the story in first person and reveal the reality that Katniss faces in the games. The way in which she drew me in as a reader with the preparations for the games and then the games itself was astounding. The final decision made by the characters I could only partially see coming.\\n\\n\\nI must state that when it comes to the use of present tense I liked it in the novel. I hate (unless it's meant to be a journal) reading first person narratives in past tense. It just makes me go: how the hell did you remember all that dialogue? Speaking of dialogue some have mentioned they found the dialogue one dimensional. I personally never noticed this but then again I have only read the books once.\\n\\nI'm going to have to get myself a copy of these books. They are definitely one of my favourite young adult series I've read. And I've read a few. Yes obtaining the series and then re-reading is definitely on the cards.\\n\\nWhile this may not be the best written series ever - although it is very well written on the whole - for can any book really challenge for being the best written work? It has heart and soul and as a reader it really draws you in. And I think that the enjoyment you gain from any book and the memories you take away are the most important things.\\n\\nSo as you've no doubt guessed I along with over 90 percent of goodreaders recommend this book and if you haven't read it and are an active goodreader where have you been? Just a question out of interest. I also highly recommend the incredible film which in my view is a pretty decent adaptation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games is actually a really smart political statement about our media dominated world. Why did I not see this before? Although I guess that makes it a sort of ironic statement since it is being published through media outlets and is making money from people's enjoyment of the violent Hunger Games inside it...\\n\\nEither way I love the whole idea of how there is this world dominated by a dictator who controls the masses through showing them his power in how he can force their young children to destroy one another. We as individuals may think that we are immune to the postulations of the media but think honestly and tell me that you've never blindly accepted a statement. Have you looked into the proper scientific backing of evolution and climate change; have you analysed the motived behind the various wars and ideologies shoved in our faces via the news; and have you ever looked into the controversial topics such as euthanasia or abortion? Or do you prefer to sit and listen to the 'even handed' coverage of the media. Which to be frank is not controlled by the reporters but by the wealthy executives who have...shock and horror...agendas.\\n\\nAnd that is what The Hunger Games portrays. A world where the wealthy prosper (they can enjoy the sadistic cruelty of the games like the Romans - and how we enjoy fictionalised violence to greater extents) and the poor are forced to hear history from their perspective. A world where rebellion is crushed by the forced execution of teenagers by teenagers. Children whose only crime is to not belong to the rich. I personally think that it's an interesting idea and one which is also entertainingly written. There are mythical motifs and interesting characters which help make the story interesting but at the end of the day it's a smart YA novel that deals sensitively with its material without being afraid to throw a few punches.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Imagine living in a post- apocalyptic world where keeping your life is your main priority in life. Well, I got that experience when I read this book called “The Hunger Games” and believe me this book took me on one dark and intense ride. “The Hunger Games” is an intense book by Suzanne Collins which details how a sixteen-year-old girl named Katniss Everdeen is thrown into the dreaded Hunger Games when she tries to save her sister, Prim from entering it. “The Hunger Games” may be too violent and intense for some readers to handle, but it is truly one of the most engaging books ever written!\\n\\nIn the ruins of North America, there is a nation called Panem where it is ruled by the Capitol, which is full of cruel and ruthless people ruling the city. Every year, the Capitol would send in a boy and a girl from each district to compete in the dreaded Hunger Games, where competitors fight to the death to survive. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen realizes that her sister Prim is about to compete in the Hunger Games, she decides to take her sister’s place to save her life and now she is competing in the Hunger Games where she has to use all of her wits and strength to survive!\\n\\nWhew! I am definitely out of breath after I read this book! When I first heard about this book, I was trying to figure out what all the hype was all about on this book, but now I know! Suzanne Collins has certainly done an awesome job at writing this book that is full of intensity and suspense! What I loved the most about this book was how Suzanne Collins had perfectly built up the pace of the action in this book so that the readers do not have to feel like they do not know the characters that well since it might cause the plot of the story to move quickly. I will admit that when I first read this book, it started out really slow, but as soon as the Hunger Games begins, the action quickly picks up and I found myself being mesmerized by Suzanne Collins’ intensive writing and exciting plot that I could not put the book down! I also loved the characters in this book, especially Katniss Everdeen herself! Katniss is the pure strong heroine in this book as she struggles to survive in the Hunger Games and I loved the way that Katniss uses her knowledge of the forest and her wit to help her get through the Hunger Games. I also admired Katniss’ courage in this book as she was able to handle any obstacle that came at her and I loved the relationship between her and Peeta. Katniss' and Peeta's relationship with each other is not your average romantic couple since they are too busy trying to survive in the Hunger Games, but there are some cute moments between the two of them. Another thing I loved about this book was how the idea of “The Hunger Games” was thought up as I never would have thought that I would read a book that takes place in a post – apocalyptic world or in this case, after the destruction of North America and that idea easily intrigues me since you wonder to yourself about how can you create another civilization after the destruction of another civilization. I also think that this book reminded me of the gladiator tournaments that were held during Ancient Rome and even some of the characters’ names in this book seem to reflect the Roman names.\\n\\nThere are many gory and violent scenes in this book, which includes many people dying in horrific ways. So, anyone who does not like gore or violence might feel a bit squeamish when reading this book. Also, the whole theme about how the Capitol toys with innocent people’s lives and views it as a sport is deeply disturbing.\\n\\nOverall, “The Hunger Games” is a truly worthy book to read over and over again and I will definitely be checking out the next two books in this fantastic series!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I can't imagine how hard it was to write a novel about kids being forced to kill each other. Probably much harder than it was to read it. After all, in my limited viewpoint as a person who also writes (although unpublished), I really dislike hurting my beloved, lifelike characters, and much less killing them, or having them do terrible things, unless they are supposed to because they are evil.\\n\\nBut Ms. Collins had to take kids between the ages of 12-16 and force them to deliberately harm each other.\\n\\nIt's a journey into a world in which a whole society plans events and festivities around such barbarism. It's not the Roman Empire. It's a dark future in which North America has become a much smaller continent called Panem. The society is a dystopic one in which the resources are not so much limited as restricted and deliberately kept from those regions whose denizens participated in a rebellion over 40 years ago. Their punishment is to have twenty-four of their children, two from each District, selected in a process called the Reaping. Those who are chosen must go and fight in the Hunger Games. If you've seen Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, then the phrase \\\"two men enter, one man leaves\\\" sort of gives you the idea. Except in this case, it's twenty-four kids enter, and one leaves.\\n\\nOur heroine, Katniss Everdeen, grows up to the age of 16 in this world. She has been taking care of her family since she was 11, hunting illegally in the forests beyond the fence around District 12, bringing back fresh meat and wild plants to feed her young sister and mother. Her heart has become hard so she can survive. But when the day comes of the Reaping, and her young sister Prim's name is called, she volunteers to go to the games in her place, almost unprecedented. Most people know that they won't return, especially the poorly-trained and outfitted tributes from District 12. But her sister is not going to face the sure death that awaits her in the Games. Not when she can.\\n\\nThe other tribute from District 12 is Peeta Mellark, the baker's son. A boy who did a life-saving act of kindness to Katniss several years before, one she can never forget. She doesn't like him for that reason, also because he reminds her of what she doesn't have, as essentially a townie, when her family lives on the fringes, the offspring of a deceased miner. However, they will have to form an alliance dreamed up by their sponsor, Haymitch, who won the Games many years before. He's a drunk, but he is going to do what he can to keep at least one of them alive in the Games.\\n\\nI wasn't looking forward to reading this. I don't care for dystopian fiction. And the thought of kids killing each other, well it doesn't work for me. However, I decided to give this a read and bought the book a few years ago. Managed to put it off until now. When the Action Heroines group on Goodreads selected it as a group read this month, the choice was made. I started it, and was crying, not too far into the book (made even more painful by the fact that I have a nasty cold right now with a bad sore throat). I was sucked in.\\n\\nI love a tough, survivor heroine, and Katniss is definitely that. Not only a survivor, but a girl who made sacrifices for her family. She's without a doubt, a very well-developed character. I like the fact that Collins takes the effort to describe Katniss' thought processes so well in this book, her woodcraft, her no-nonsense approach to life. How she suppresses those soft emotions that would have been a liability to her in her present situation. But deep down, how Katniss has the potential for love, and she does love. When Katniss bonds with another tribute, a young girl named Rue, who reminds her of Primrose, I could literally hear and feel my heart breaking. We all know how this ends. And Katniss best of all. But that doesn't mean you can stop feeling emotions, even when the brutal reality of your existence and forced choices seem to dictate otherwise.\\n\\nThat's part of what makes this a difficult story. The fact that kids are forced into a world in which they starve to death, not because there is nothing to eat, but because someone feels that they shouldn't have the basic things like a full belly and a safe life, for political reasons. That's going on today in this world. It should break a person's heart, and it does. Is this so very out there, when in real life, there are child soldiers in the world right now? I know I'm going towards \\\"Soapbox\\\" territory, so I'll stop myself. Yeah, I guess that's the point. Why should I keep my blindfold on to these horrors and immerse myself in safe, happy tales all the time? And forget that events like this do happen (maybe not in this obvious, fictional landscape kind of way), but in a way that is lot less showcased, and much more brutal.\\n\\nI admit I liked the role reversal here. Peeta, the boy is more emotional, more approachable, more in need of protection. And Katniss is tougher, more armored, the protector. That doesn't hold true across the map, for Peeta shows depths that surprise Katniss and the reader. And likewise, Katniss has her moments when she doesn't have it all figured out.\\n\\nSince this is first person, we don't get to find out how the grown-ups feel about this travesty. But I can surmise that people like Haymitch, Cinna, even Effie feel their share of anguish for the roles they play every year, as they watch twenty-four more children go off, most of them to their deaths, even if it's well-hidden.\\n\\nIt's a mad world, and all this comes together in this story to propel me through a gamut of emotions, most of them uncomfortable. I could almost identify with the kids, that horror of knowing, \\\"This is it.\\\" The Games are real. I was there with them, and I wasn't spared the realness. I guess that's another reason to respect this work, that the author doesn't soften such a terrible concept. She doesn't allow you to settle into a false sense of security that it will be alright. That would only be a form of contempt in my mind. If you're going to go there, then bring it. And she does.\\n\\nMy final verdict: The Hunger Games is tough reading. But it's complex and powerful, and completely involving. I couldn't stop reading this until I was done.\"\n",

This book grips you from the beginning to the end, full of white-knuckle action and relatable characters that steal your heart from the beginning.\\nAs this is one of the most read, and reviewed, books of all time, I'm not going to go into detail on my personal opinion. Here's just a short list of positive and negative elements. (Note: some of these are not my personal opinion, just things to be aware of before jumping into this tale)\\n\\nPositive Elements:\\n1) Sacrifice. Katniss demonstrates this multiple times as she spends time in the woods hunting so she can support her starving family, and later when she takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games.\\n2) Good writing. This is one of the only first person present writings I've ever read that flows naturally without sounding awkward.\\n3) Plot. Though straightforward, the plot still carries a lot of weight.\\n4) Character development. All of the characters, main and secondary alike, are fully formed and well developed, making them jump off the page.\\n\\nNegative Elements:\\n1) Blood and gore. Obviously the Hunger Games are a terrible fight to the death, making room for lots of less than nice descriptions. However, I give the author credit for keeping much of the gore to a pretty fair minimum.\\n2) The characters. Very few of the characters are actually people we should strive to be. Katniss is a good example of this. While lovable because she is so realistic, she is also hopeless and bitter, and that's not something readers should strive to attain. The characters are good because they are realistic, not because they're good role models.\\n3) The premise. Though well-formed, it should be taken into consideration that the book is based around deception and death.\\n4) Obsessive. Due to its gripping plot, characters, and writing, this book tends to worm its way into your mind so you are thinking 24/7 about kids killing other kids. While surviving is a good thing, it should never be anyone's top priority.\\n\\nDespite its short-comings, this is still a wonderful, fast-paced read that I would recommend for teens and adults alike. As long as you are aware of the inherent problems, they can be overlooked to a certain extent.\\n\\n***EDIT*** After reviewing this review (haha) awhile after reading these books and now not being on a book high, I would just like to add that the second two books are not at all worth your time and the first one probably isn't either. While it's a good book to read if you want mindless action, it won't give you anything. It's empty and hopeless. That's the 2 cents of an older Denali who can now look at this more objectively. Enjoy. XD\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"This might have some spoilers about books that aren't this one. You have been warned.\\n\\nPart way through the second book of Suzanne Collins' Gregor the Overlander series it struck me what I really liked about her. She had no problem with killing off someone in the story, and not in the 'oh you think the person is dead, but then they turn out alive' kind of way. Nope she'd just knock someone off when you weren't even expecting it. Not a lot of writers will do this. Generally you can expect that in the middle of a book a likable character isn't going to get killed, but she did this in a book for eight year olds.\\n\\nHer other series is pretty satisfying as far as kid's books go, they are very simple to read but they are still good.\\n\\nHonestly this could have been an adult novel. I don't really know where the line is between young adult and adult novels, but this is about as dark a dystopia as most of those created, and unlike most dystopian novels this one actually is engaging once you get past the social commentary and interesting (or not so interesting way) the author has imagined a future world full of shit. Maybe it is because Collins doesn't hark on the dystopia aspect too much that it is a books for kids, but she lays out enough of the awfulness and gives enough social criticism to keep the ideas of a futile and oppressive future pretty firmly rooted into every page of the novel.\\n\\nAnd then there is the story, it's about kids killing kids in a reality tv show that everyone in the country is forced to watch. Ever since , (movie or short story), I have been fascinated with the idea of people killing each in a reality TV show, and this falls into that tradition that also includes .\\n\\nThis book is better than , which I really liked, but which kind of got a bit stale at some point. It's sort of like , mixed with Jackson's short story \\\"The Lottery\\\" (the only short story I can remember really liking as a middle school student).\\n\\nI'm a little afraid of the second book. I'm not sure if the story can keep up the momentum this one had.\\n\\nEven if I don't like the next book in the series, I can love the top rated review already up for the next book, it makes me feel all warm inside that I can really love a book that seems to appeal to the 'who will the main character really love' interest that produces, and has the same name calling as if the characters were real people. It feels good to be involved in mass pop-culture. Now bring on the TV show where kids hunt other kids down, that might be what I need to finally get an antenna or cable in my apartment.\"\n",

To be in the first person, and that first person to supposedly be abt. 18 with little education... well, I just don't buy the way that she is talking, and it's bouncing me out of the story bad. It doesn't help that she describes a lot of things that don't need describing too, 'I watched Gale cut the bread'.... Come on, can't Gale just cut the bread? All the 'I' statements make for a rather tedious self-absorbed perspective. First person doesn't have to be that way though, naughty lazy writer. Bad, no Nobel for you. I'm really really hoping this gets better, and I plan to finish if for no other reason than further research into what sort of writing can become a best seller. So far though... well... it's agony.\\n\\nArg! \\\"Conducted, slumber, verve, tenuous, of late...\\\" Are these really words/expressions that this character would use? Really? I call BS. This book is driving me crazy. And yes, I know that these complaints make me sound like some diction harpy, but come on!\\n\\nOh thank god I'm done with this sad excuse for a novel. I read all the way to the end hoping that all the graphic nonsense would build up to something. Sad sad sad. The voice never got better, or well it remained what seemed to be a 45yr old recently fired psychopathic adjunct professor and I found it impossible to suspend my disbelief. The gore was never a problem because I never cared for any of the characters. Of course it tried to play at the themes of tyranny and brutality, but with classics like _House of Stairs_, and _Lord of the Flies_ Why would you torture yourself with this?\\n\\nOn evaluation for why this book has been such a success, I think the lesson here is action. It does buzz along at a furious clip, and perhaps when I was younger that would have been enough for me to overlook flaws. But I suppose that is why I generally stay away from this varietal of fiction anymore... matter of fact, I think I'll go back to that plan A.\"\n",

Rather, it’s how deep of a level it reaches. I just finished it, so naturally there hasn’t been enough time for reflection, but in these few moments, my stream of thought is going spastic. The book jacket wasn’t lying—there’s mystery, adventure, romance, suspense, all of that in here. And yet the substance of the novel surpasses just these box-office-hit qualities (which is all I can compare those four adjectives to).\\n\\nThe world building was fantastic. While it’s quite a different land than current North America, Panem had some disturbing parallels relating to the society, especially of its higher class (the lower-number districts and the Capitol). The fixation with the sappy romance, the fact the games were more like a deadlier reality show of nowadays than anything else, the frivolousness... It was quite unnerving. So clever. Only adds another layer to this story.\\n\\nNot many books have kept me on the edge of my seat. This plot is brilliant. Truth be told, I’m not the biggest fan of thrillers and am fine with books that employ the “girl-next-door” dynamics to its plot—quiet, but charming and accessible. Well, needless to say, this book is anything but quiet. But it is bewitching.\\n\\nYou know what? I’ll stop. There’s nothing I can say that hasn’t already been said. Plus I could stay here all night. I wasn’t kidding when I said my mind is going spastic with all the directions this book gives it to think things out.\\n\\nNot recommending it to everyone though. Some really hate violence. Some really hate dystopia. I’d still give it a shot if you’re one of those people, but I wouldn’t specifically recommend it to you. Everyone else? Knock yourselves out. This is one of the ultimate must-reads right in front of you.\\n\\nBut in short: this book is AWESOME.\"\n",

I was completely blown away, in a good way. :) The plot, the characters, the entire world Collins created is completely original and unlike anything I've ever encountered before. I'd heard that this book was good, but I had no idea that it would be this amazing. Why I let it sit on my shelf for so long before giving it a shot is beyond my comprehension.\\n\\nFrom the very fist chapter, I felt myself bonding with the characters. They are incredibly realistic, and they bring the story to life. Katniss is a strong protagonist that I can admire and believe. Unlike some strong female characters, Katniss' tough personality is a learned skill instead of a personality trait. This helped me to understand her a lot more. The other tributes and characters are equally interesting. They all certainly added to my love of the novel.\\n\\nI've always loved drama. Who doesn't like a bit of suspense in their books? Everything about The Hunger Games is dramatic- from the reaping to the games. I was constantly wondering what would happen next. This is one of the first books I've read in a long time that had me sneaking away to my room every chance I got. I was desperate to find out what happened next. While the concept of teens battling it out in an area is somewhat disturbing, it was impossible to not be fascinated.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games is now one of my favorite books. It was absolutely brilliant, and I will be recommending it to all of my fellow readers.

      "      \"review\": \"Note, September 5, 2015 --I edited this review just now to correct two misspelled words.\\n\\nFor me, the extremely dark premise of this novel, as set out in the Goodreads description above, was a deterrent to reading it. While I'm a fan of brave heroines who can physically fight the forces of (adult) evil, the dynamic is different when the heroine we're asked to root for is thrown into an arena with 23 other 12-18 year old kids and told that only one can come out alive, all for the entertainment of adult sickos, and for the intimidation of their home districts. It's to Collins' credit as an author that she takes this premise and molds it into a tale that's profoundly morally conscious, and testifies to the strength of the human spirit and humane feelings. The book definitely does not pander to the tastes of the kind of people who would relish seeing (or visualizing) teens and pre-teens forced to kill each other.\\n\\nIt does bring us face-to-face with gut-wrenching ethical questions. Would YOU volunteer to put yourself into that arena, to save a sibling? How far would you go to keep yourself alive in that setting? How far you go? Would you take the lives of other innocents, who didn't want to be there any more than you do --but who will also be viewing you as someone who has to die if they're going to live? (Granted, not all these kids are so innocent --the Career tributes tend to be volunteers who like the idea of killing to win a life of wealth and ease; they're sadistic sociopaths now, who'd likely grow up to be adult sadistic sociopaths. But they're still kids at the moment, realistically shaped by a very brutal society.) Would you kill someone you genuinely like, who's not trying to hurt you? Would you kill someone who loves you? Someone YOU love? Could you accept your own death voluntarily, or even commit suicide? These questions aren't academic for Katniss, and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta. The thing that changes this book from the total downer it could have been to one that's in a real way uplifting is the fact that Collins' main characters, and some others, check their sense of decency and their humanity at the arena entrance; they try to retain both, and manage to display both, as a light against the pitch black darkness of the situation. \\\"I don't want them to change me in there,\\\" Peeta says at one point. \\\"Turn me into some kind of monster that I'm not.\\\" At a fundamental level, this is a book about not becoming a monster, in the face of a social order that's out to make you one.\\n\\nThat social order is another major theme of the book. We're looking here at a future America where the government is a completely self-serving law unto itself, which has subjects (not citizens) with, as far as it's concerned, no intrinsic rights, and which has no regard at all for human life as such; a society where inequalities of wealth and power are maintained by the vicious use of unrestrained force, and where the enormous resources of society are wasted on frivolous and even harmful projects while the working populace lacks basic medical care and is stalked by starvation. It's an America where dissent is criminalized and intimidated into silence, where the economic order is a dead-end of peonage and servitude for all but a few, with no hope of advancement, and where real human beings are simply grist for an entertainment industry that's all about manipulation and exploitation, without any concern for the human cost. An argument has been made to the effect that this novel isn't a true dystopian novel like or because the people of Panem aren't that badly off (though I suspect they'd dispute that!), and because Collins supposedly doesn't clearly articulate what present-day trends she sees as setting the stage for this future. I would submit that every tendency described above is already present in our time in germinal form. If Collins doesn't explicitly articulate how pre-apocalyptic America --where the ultimate expression of these trends is restrained by (waning) morality, a vestigial Constitution and somewhat contested elections, even if they're manipulated-- devolves into her post-apocalyptic America where all restraints are removed, maybe it's because she prefers to let us connect the dots.\\n\\nFor the type of plot and premise we have here, this isn't as grisly and gory as it could be; Collins shows us the ugliness and viciousness of the Games and their human cost, but she shows restraint in direct description, so that this doesn't become the \\\"pornography of violence\\\" the Capitol residents (and some of their present-day counterparts) revel in. There's no bad language or unwholesome sexual content. The writing is compulsively readable, a page-turner with no dull moments, and the situation and events make it one of the most evocative reads I've ever experienced --painful, harrowing, terrible and beautiful. Collins chooses to write through Katniss' eyes, in first-person present; this puts us right inside the protagonist's head and gives the narrative an immediacy that grabs you by the throat. To my surprise, it didn't feel gimmicky or awkward at all, but flowed like a stream --or, more accuately, a whitewater torrent!-- from the opening sentence. Katniss and Peeta are wonderfully realized characters, whom I found wholly believable, liked, admired and rooted for from the get-go.\\n\\nIn the view of some of my Goodreads friends who've read the whole trilogy, the third book really pulls the entire series down, and ruins the portrait of Katniss that Collins constructed earlier. But be that as it may, this first book is, by itself, a powerful and compelling read that I would highly recommend.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I’m late to the party, I know. Back in the day, when this was the talk of my middle school, I used to lie that I read it, and since my sister had actually read them and gave me a point-by-point plot summary immediately after reading each book in the series, I felt at age 12 that I already had read it, or at least knew enough to trick people into thinking I had. And I watched all the movies and really enjoyed them; I’ve even seem them more than once.\\n\\nBut I’m not an animal now and I have some standards. I decided that it’s now or never, and I picked this up. And despite knowing the plot already, I found myself getting caught up in this tale, but it wasn’t as easy as I thought it would be. I feel that the fandom has died down enough by now that I can say this without being placed in the Games myself, but oh my goodness, the first chapter was horrible!\\n\\nLet me explain. Think of the textbook what not to do in a first chapter: heavy exposition awkwardly placed throughout the scene, inconsistent narrative voice, white room syndrome. This had all of those. In abundance. I’m not a huge fan of first person, but when it’s consistent, I can get behind it alright. But this first chapter constantly flipped between feeling like a story being regaled to me at a later date by the main character, and like I was witnessing events unfolding in the moment. I could never quite tell which was which, as Katniss would literally be walking around, and then suddenly launch into irrelevant backstory, only to go back to the scene unfazed. Were these the thoughts Katniss herself was having in that moment? Why would she feel the need to explain why she’s going hunting if this is just what she does every day? Or if this is a story being told, in the future about the past, and these are just important details I need to know to understand the rest, why is the rest of the book told in a way that implies immediacy?\\n\\nIt felt like Collins knew she needed to introduce this info for thematic reasons but had no idea how to do that successfully. (And she did expand on all of this very well throughout the book, but I still can’t ignore how mediocre the introduction was.) I didn’t get a handle on who Katniss even was in the first chapter, though I did get a sense of Gale and even Prim to a degree. Katniss felt like a complete blank slate, an empty window for the reader to peer through at Panem, devoid of personality and even, on occasion, a body. But then she developed, slowly, but surely, into a person, by the time the third chapter rolled around. I’m utterly baffled that it was so poorly done; that a book this popular, with this much acclaim, got away with a garbage beginning.\\n\\nIt didn’t help that beyond being first person, I wasn’t a fan of the writing style. I’m an audiobook reader mostly. My preferred method of reading is to listen and look, so that my brain simply isn’t given a chance to drift off because I have input from my eyes and my ears. And I’ve learned, as I read books by different authors with different styles, that some authors really don’t like using dialogue tags, that they like inserting character thoughts between dialogue, even if it isn’t their speech. And this, for an audiobook, is almost impossible to interpret, especially if the speaker is the thinker. There’s no way to determine if something was said out loud or simply in the character’s head. I don’t know, then, what the other people in the scene do or don’t know. Or who is speaking at any given moment, especially if it’s a volleying exchange. It makes some scenes borderline incomprehensible. This is basically the reason why I DNF’d The Wrath and the Dawn by Renée Ahdieh. I literally didn’t know what was going on.\\n\\nHonestly, if it wasn’t for the movie and my faded knowledge of the general story, I would have DNF’d after the first chapter. I’m really glad I didn’t though. After the rough start, this was totally awesome!\\n\\nMy favorite thing, and the thing that startled me the most, was Peeta. I absolutely loved him! Every single moment with him was great, and the thematic purposes he served, and how sarcastic but also genuinely sweet he was really did it for me. He was a gem, through and through. Cinna was a surprise favorite also, and since I know what happens, I’ve decided to preemptively cry.\\n\\nThe Games are a given. They’re fun and intense, in a way that makes me wonder if I’m horrible for loving it. But that’s what’s great about this book. It vilifies you too. It makes you question your own standing in society; what you allow through apathy or through misdirected action; what horrors you condone for your own pleasure, ignoring the suffering of others, even if it’s a small, seemingly inconsequential thing. It makes the bad things fun, and it makes you entertained but feel bad for feeling entertained.\\n\\nI know this review sounds like I didn’t like it. I did, truly. It was epic and profound, and gave me what most of the copycats in the dystopian craze really lacked: something to say and a story to tell. I’m really glad I finally read this, and I’m excited to continue the series.\"\n",

You're blinded by a bright light, but that only adds to the shakiness enveloping your limbs. You know very well that at any moment within the next hour, you could die.\\n\\nYou see the large horn they call the Cornucopia overflowing with weapons, food, and supplies. You look around, seeing the 23 other tributes poised and ready to run. You crouch down as well as the 60-second timer begins to count down.\\n\\nBreathe in and out. You turn your head from side to side and roll your shoulders. You have one goal- survive.\\n\\nAdrenaline coursing through your veins, you tell yourself one thing.\\n\\nYou will not fail.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you've read you know there's nothing that makes your heart pound more than imagining yourself on that metal platform, awaiting the countdown and the final ring of the gong. Wondering if you would fight or flee, if you would die sooner rather than later. How far would you make it? Could you rely on nothing but your sense of survival to keep you alive?\\n\\nAnd most importantly,\\n\\nBooks that swallow your thoughts like this are utterly thrilling. The world created is one that feels so real that you imagine you were there yourself, a tribute from your district going to fight to the death in an arena. That's truly what keeps you on the edge of your seat as you're reading- that, and your motivation for the main character to survive.\\n\\nI would consider this book a classic in literature. I would be surprised if you’ve never heard of it, because at one point it was sweeping the world. To me, it’s original, striking, and captivating from the very start. There is no part in this book that I ever found myself bored- and I’m sure there wasn’t any for you either.\\n\\nThese characters are tougher than I’ll probably ever be. Katniss and I couldn’t be more different, but that’s what I find so interesting about her. Just as Peeta recalled, If we’re being honest, if I were in her position I would probably not last the first 5 minutes of the Games. But watching her persevere, watching her fight for her life, watching her make unimaginable decisions really attached me to her.\\n\\nPeeta, on the other hand, is such a cinnamon roll. I know a lot of people don’t like his character for certain reasons (*ahem* the love triangle *ahem*) but he will forever be a favorite of mine. I’ll admit, when the Games first started I thought he was a traitor. But his relationship with Katniss as the contest wore on was something I grew to like very much.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough I am an Everlark shipper, I think Gale deserves some credit too. I mean, he was Katniss’ best friend for so many years- they supported and depended on each other. Personally, I love him (or maybe I just love Liam Hemsworth’s face. Who knows) and I think that he’s by far one of the most underrated characters.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn a side note, the movie adaptations to these books are worth a chef’s kiss. They kept to the plotline of the books, they had accurate casting, and they portrayed the character’s emotions just as well as the books. The way the world was built through the visual screen was entrancing, and every moment had my heart racing even as I knew how it ended.\\n\\nIn all, this series is one that I will never be able to forget.\"\n",

We are told this boring story with little regard for environment, coloration, or even useful description that might be used to draw even the slightly intellectual reader into this lame excuse for a narrative.\\n\\nOh, I know.

She drove me nuts! I used to love her so much, and now she just drives me insane! And there's that can change my stance on that. She just made me so mad! The girl is clueless, slow, and doesn't care for anyone but herself and I can't stand it! She treats Peeta like crap, then toys with his emotions, which hurts him in the end! She didn't get it when Haymitch said What did you think that meant, huh?! That he magically knew everything going on?! Haymitch literally said he didn't need to tell Peeta 'cause he's already there. She immediately dismissed the thought of Peeta loving her with the thought: 🤦🏻‍♀️\\n\\nThe she only cares for herself. At the beginning of the games she stopped caring about Peeta, the boy who'd saved her life all those years ago. Then, her mom. She was awful to her mom! I know that her mom shut down when her dad died, but Katniss's dad was the love of her mom's life. Her mom didn't expect him to go so soon. They'd been happy. Of course she's going to get depressed! And Katniss let's that effect the way she treats her mom for the rest of the series! She doesn't respect her mom at ALL and it makes me so mad. 😠\\n\\nNext issue. How she's always mad about her current life situation. When their poor, she says Then, she gets whisked away to the capital, and it's and crap like that. And, when she wins the games it's I understand that you're used to caring for your family through hunting, and your not used to having money, but it isn't fair to constantly be mad at everything in your life all the time. Be grateful for what you have! 😠\\n\\nPeeta-\\nPeeta, Peeta, Peeta. You can do much better than Miss. Katniss Everdeen. So much better.\\n\\nFirst off, am I the only one who finds it hilarious that his name is and he's the son of a ? Okay, back on track. Sorry, I just HAD to point that out. You'll never be able to read the books the same way again. 🤪 I didn't preplan the Wonder bread (🤣) thing before writing it out.\\n\\nAnyway, back to Peeta. Peeta is such an amazing person. I think took all of Katniss's good qualities and just dumped them all on Peeta. He doesn't have one bad... crap. I just ruined Peeta for myself! HE DOESN'T HAVE A CHARACTER FLAW! He, I... I just can't now.\\n\\nGale-\\nOh, Gale. Poor, hurt Gale. Grown up. Life isn't all about you. Katniss has a right to her own opinion. But, you have an actual character flaw so..... I'M TEAM GALE NOW! I'm just kidding, I'm not that mad about Peeta.\\n\\nPeeta is twice the man Gale will ever be in my opinion. Gale is like me in the fact that he has too much fire. He is very defensive about his opinions and won't let anyone mess with him or his family. I know what it's like to have fire when it comes to opinions. I'm feel very strongly about my opinions.\\n\\nHaymitch-\\nDo you know how bad that I wish Haymitch was a real person? I would just love to meet him. He just seems like one of those people that would have advice on everything.\\n\\nEffie-\\nThe fact that she's so clueless is the best thing ever. She's so stupid and I love her for it. 😂\\n\\nCinna-\\nI also want to meet Cinna, because he's just amazing! I also want him to make me a wardrobe, because he makes such beautiful clothes! Oh, and he gives good advice too. 😂 He is one of those people that you just want to go and hug.\\n\\n\\n\\nBook Content-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlot- The games have only just begun.\\nKatniss Everdeen has survived in District 12's harsh environment, she's survived hunger, and losing her father. But the Hunger Games are different. They aren't about finding food for her family, they aren't about protecting her family, there about surviving to be the last tribute standing. And everyone wants to survive.\\n\\nCussing- D word\\n\\nViolence- Mentions of blowing up, animal death, murder, stabbing, shooting, attempted drowning, wasp attack, breaking necks, land mines, poisoning, and hunting.\\n\\nSexual Content- Katniss and Peeta kiss. 🤯\\n\\n\\n\\n*******************\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, 500 years later, were coming to the end of the review! After writing this, I've killed most of my love for this book without even meaning to. Oops.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I won't bother to summarise plot and characters since The Hunger Games and its sequels are so high profile. After many recommendations from friends I trust, I bought the first book and read it in a couple of days. The concept of deadly competitive games in a dystopic society is not new, but Collins gives it a new spin, making comment on the society we live in where 'reality' television is devoured by couch potato viewers with little sense of what is real and what is orchestrated for the cameras.\\n\\nSome people have criticised the level of violence in the story but it's well-handled and never gratuitous. Without it we wouldn't get a true idea of the horrific scenario in which Katniss and Peeta find themselves. As a writer, I found much to admire in Collins' mastery of pace and tension in this story, and her ability to inject humour into very dark situations. I found Katniss a strong and interesting protagonist, but was not entirely convinced by her blindness to Peeta's true feelings (or her own feelings, for that matter.)\\n\\nI did enjoy The Hunger Games very much, but having peeked at the synopses of books two and three, I am not completely convinced that I will find them as satisfying. I hope Collins manages to keep the arbitrary changes of Games rules convincing. Will review again when I've read the second book.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Sometime in the future, the Earth has met the fate we are only now prophesying: the ocean has risen, the coastal cities have disappeared, all manner of environmental disasters have occurred. In North America, the survivors created Panem, a Capitol city in the Rockies with 13 outlying Districts, each focusing on producing a different product for the Capitol: gems, coal, agriculture, fishing etc.\\n\\nIn Katniss' district, District 12, they mine coal. It's one of the poorest districts, a district that never stands a chance in the Hunger Games because the children are so starving. Since her father died in a mining accident when she was twelve, Katniss has hunted illegally in the forest, developing a formidable skill with the bow and arrow to bring fresh meat back to the town to trade for things for her family: her mother and her little sister Prim.\\n\\nNow sixteen, Katniss finds herself in a nightmare predicament: against all odds, her twelve-year-old sister Prim has been selected as a tribute for the Hunger Games. After a rebellion amongst the Districts against the Capitol was ferociously put down years ago, the city instigated the Hunger Games as a deathly reminder that the working people of the Districts live by the Capitol's whim. The people of the Capitol treat the Games like the year's best entertainment, and are giddy with excitement to watch twenty-four children aged from 12 to 18 - a boy and girl from each District - kill each other before the cameras, and the victor is celebrated like a hero. In the Districts, winning the Hunger Games brings fame and food to your district, and the winner is set for life.\\n\\nBut Prim is only twelve, and aside from having her mother's knack at healing, has no survival skills. Katniss doesn't hesitate for a moment before volunteering to take her place.\\n\\nLet the Hunger Games begin.\\n\\n\\nThe YA field is ideal for exploring post-apocalyptic worlds and the changing, often brutal nature of humanity - I think because its readers, typically 13+, are at the age where they too are changing and discovering themselves as independent people. What more intense, vivid way is there to explore the great philosophical questions of human nature in an entertaining and gripping way than through post-apocalyptic fiction? In times of crisis and chaos and our own worst nightmares, we discover what we're made of.\\n\\nis a wonderful new addition to the canon. Leaning more toward sci-fi than fantasy with its advanced technology, it resurrects the horror people can inflict on each other that was so well captured in the short story ; the cruelty of pitting innocent children against each other that was so vividly brought to life in (not a YA book but one which is most similar to this); and the survival instincts and honour that can come to the surface when faced with a kill-or-be-killed scenario, which reminded me of one of my favourite series, John Marsden's Tomorrow series. I'm sure you can think of many more too.\\n\\nNarrated by Katniss, it's a good guess that she survives (though I wouldn't have been surprised to have that expectation turned on me), since she does narrate in the present tense. That in itself is a somewhat unusual choice and I'm not entirely sure it worked here. Present tense is generally used to create more tension, a stronger feeling of \\\"now\\\" and of an unpredictable future - everything you need in the Hunger Games. Perhaps it was the incorrect use of the past tense \\\"lay\\\" instead of the present tense \\\"lie\\\" that cropped up constantly that jarred me? It certainly annoyed me! No, it was because, somehow, it read more like Katniss telling a story long after it had happened. I can't quite put my finger on how this could be, but it lacked the tension that other books using present tense have managed to capture, which was a bit disappointing.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games themselves were riveting, much like the grisly slaughter of but less gory. There were a couple of scenes that I wished I weren't eating breakfast over, but most of the deaths happen \\\"off screen\\\", as it were. What's more compelling is the class divide that gapes as wide as the jaws of Hell, the prejudice and persecution and the politics behind it all - I'm sure this will be more fully explored in the next books in the series.\\n\\nI was a bit disappointed that the initial cause of the problems in this world, the environmental degradation and, ultimately, destruction, wasn't explored further - nor were the handy technological advances seen in the Capitol. Granted, it's not the focal point of the story, merely helps set up the premise, but I find the lack of personal responsibility and this assumption that someone will invent the technology to make everything better that I hear all around me today, is reflected between the lines of this novel. Things just magically appear in the Capitol, and isn't that our dream? To have the best our intellect can give us without any consequence? Yet, this book is all about consequences, just of a different sort of action. So this isn't a quibble about the story; it just made me think of the many flaws in our own world that, even after this particular \\\"apocalypse\\\", are still being repeated.\\n\\nKatniss herself is a great protagonist, with spunk, survival skills that make us look helpless (few people know what's edible in the wild and what isn't, who aren't botanists, or what leaves draw pus from wounds etc.), and conflicting emotions that are no less familiar for the situation she's in. The scene with Rue and the bread from District 11 made me cry, but it was the memory Katniss retells of Peeta giving her the bread when they were children that won me over.\\n\\nLike many new fans of Collins, I'll be eagerly waiting the second book in the series, , due out 1st September 2009.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I can always admit when I'm wrong, and in this case I was wrong. I thought that I either wouldn't like this book or I would just think it was OK. I thought it was fantastic. The story is very real and gripping. It has depth, and I loved how it brought in politics and entertainment and was slamming the media. It was great. Some of the scenes were genuinely terrifying (the dogs scared the shit out of me and genuinely disturbed me) while some were heart breaking (you all know which scene ripped my heart out but I was also surprisingly really upset about Foxface too). I loved Haymitch and kept getting annoyed when Katniss was really rude about him, moaning about him being an alcoholic and a coward, etc. After having already been through what she was about to go through, I think he's allowed to be grumpy and drink as much as he wants. I did still like Katniss, though. She was a great heroine and I loved that she was three dimensional. She had character flaws and these weren't hidden or glossed over. Peeta is lovely, and I would definitely want him as my friend. I also love Effie, I hope there's more of her in the next two books.\\n\\nMy only gripe was that I felt like there was too much focus on the fake/real romance between Peeta and Katniss. It wasn't the main plot, which meant I didn't mind it too much, but they spent a lot of time on it. I was getting bored when they ended up spending so long in that cave with Katniss trying to fake the romance. I understood why they were getting them to do it, and I appreciate it, but I just didn't really like it. However, I do now have an opinion on the love triangle which I didn't really have one either way before. I think Katniss clearly doesn't like Peeta as much as she likes Gale so she should be with Gale and I'll be with Peeta. That just seems like the right option for everyone. Ok, my opinion on this may have also been slightly pushed by the movies (Josh>Liam for me) but, still. I just think it sounds like the most logical next step.\\n\\nOverall, I actually loved reading this and I really enjoyed myself. It was fascinating and exciting and I'll definitely be reading the next two books at some point.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I know that everyone has already read this and reviewed it but I have Opinions™ so here's a full review.\\n\\nFirstly, does it deserve the hype? My answer is, mostly, yes it does.\\n\\nThis is better than a lot of the other books in the genre and has a complex lead. It's fast-paced, gritty, and at parts it read more like a survival story than a dystopia which I am very happy about.\\n\\nI really enjoyed Katniss's character; she's multifaceted and easy to empathise with, strong but also vulnerable and has some very human weaknesses, and despite not being what one would traditionally call \\\"feminine\\\" she didn't look down on girls who weren't like her (as we see in how much she loved her sister and her friendship with Rue). The only instances where there was girl-on-girl hate felt justified because Something else I enjoyed was the . I liked how it was slow burn, complicated, never took over the story, and I think Katniss and Peeta had good chemistry (Team Peeta, Gale kind of sucked).\\n\\nMoving away from Katniss the world building was done really well, significantly better than most dystopia. Mainly because It was nice to see a tyrannical government that uses propaganda more than fear and I could very easily imagine how poor is District 12.\\n\\nHowever like I said I don't think this is perfect; the writing was mostly okay but there were some weird sentences here and there that pulled me out of the story. For example;\\n\\nI also think that the side characters weren't developed enough. I liked that they didn't all fit into being either good or bad but I wish that we saw more layers to them,\\n\\nIn conclusion I think that it's slightly overhyped, but it's still a good book. I will be reading the sequel .\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Teen melodrama set against the backdrop of an evil, fascist state in which children are tortured and forced to kill for the entertainment of the masses. The moral implications of the protagonist's situation are not adequately addressed. The author lets Katniss off too easy, being too afraid of making her hero unsympathetic or showing the real emotional trauma and deep psychological scars she would have suffered. (Perhaps she does in the later books but I have no interest in reading them.) After the murder, killing, and torture it all comes down to teen love? Blech. Collins creates a very, very dark world and doesn't have the courage to deal with its consequences.\\n\\nYou don't set a story in Auschwitz and then make it all about boys.\\n\\nEDIT: For the hell of it, I decided to write a longer review.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo me the most interesting question of the book is how someone copes in a situation in which one is asked to kill innocent people to save one’s own life. Although I’m not entirely sure, my understanding is the major religions would prohibit such an action. In Collins’s story, though, this issue is almost completely side-stepped. It never crosses Katniss’s or anyone else’s mind that, although the government of Panem is clearly evil for having the Games in the first place, even the participants themselves are morally culpable for not resisting. The government will kill their family if they don’t play? OK, but isn’t it well-established in American and English common law, to say nothing of common sense morality, that duress and necessity are not defenses to murder?\\n\\nKatniss demonstrates no moral sense about what is being asked of her. She is a slave being asked to commit acts of pornography to gratify a decadent and sick public. Does she not resent being exploited this way? The scenes where the book really began to trouble me were during Katniss’s makeover and the interview before the games started. The argument can be made these scenes were meant to satirize reality TV, but I agree with those who say they instead seem to celebrate it.\\n\\nThe person that bothered me the most during this part of the book is Cinna. He’s a disgusting human being, isn’t he? His job is to make these children attractive and beautiful before they’re sent off to slaughter each other, debased like animals. How does he sleep at night? How does he live with himself knowing that he is perpetuating such a system? What if his job was to make the girls pretty so they would look their best before being raped? Isn’t that what we have in this story, only worse?\\n\\nI began thinking about Cinna and the larger society that supports these games. I remember Collins saying that “everyone” watches the games. If true, that is not a society worth saving or caring about. Are you telling me there are no conscientious objectors? There is no protest movement? There is no peaceful or passive resistance? There are no parents who have instructed their children that, if chosen, they should refuse to play and that the family is willing to suffer the consequences to not be a part of such a vile pathology?\\n\\nIf you think I’m taking this idea too seriously, look at how people reacted to the Kony video. Children kidnapped or pressed into fighting a war, and it becomes the fastest viral video perhaps ever.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome have described Katniss as “totally vicious” or “selfish, unsympathetic, and straight up awful.” Please. She is nothing of the sort. She is the hero we are clearly meant to admire and identify with. I don’t know if she’s vicious or awful because SHE’S NEVER ASKED TO MAKE ANY DIFFICULT DECISIONS.\\n\\nHer one act of bravery and sacrifice comes at the beginning of the story when she volunteers in her sister’s stead. After that, she must survive, but her character is never truly tested. Collins is too afraid of making her hero unsympathetic, she’s too afraid of alienating her readers, she wants too much to be liked, to push her heroine to the dark places such a situation demands. For example, killing Rue. Or killing Peeta. Or, mirroring her act of sacrifice to save her sister, by letting Peeta kill her. Instead, Rue is dispatched by one of the “bad” guys. Katniss only kills those who “deserve” it, i.e. the Career tributes. She is spared from having to kill anyone good.\\n\\nPeople, even children, are capable of far, far worse when the situation is sufficiently extreme. Take the story of Shin In Geun, who was born in and spent the first 23 years of his life in a North Korean prison camp. Indoctrinated by the state, when he was 13 years old he discovered his mother and brother were planning to flee the camp. Like a good North Korean, he informed the officials of their plan. Both were executed:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe biggest issue Katniss faces? Which boy she likes.\\n\\n\\n1.The sponsors are unnecessary. Given that the government can change the rules at will, and they control all aspects of the game, what do the sponsors get out of helping the kids? (Perhaps commercials. “That slit throat is brought to you by Coca-Cola.”) The main reason Collins includes the sponsors is to provide her weak storytelling with a deux ex machina. Whatever Katniss needs most periodically falls out of the sky.\\n2.But the most egregious problem is the rule change that allows both Katniss and Peeta to live. This is presented as one of the diabolical things the government does to mess with the contestants, but really it’s an easy way for Collins to provide a cheap plot twist and sustain the stupid Katniss-Peeta-Gale love triangle. Yes, the government changes the rule back, but it’s the laziest sort of manipulation.\\n\\nIt’s my understanding that Collins, the daughter of a military officer, was trying to convey the experience of war. But it’s war as a video game with no real stakes, no real consequences other than whether the winner will be Team Peeta or Team Gale (which I assume is dealt with in the subsequent books).\\n\\nIf you want a great story about children being forced into warfare, read Ender’s Game.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Reread #???: November 19—November 21st 2023\\n\\n\\nthe hunger games renaissance is here baby let’s gooooooo 🤌\\n\\n\\n\\n————————————————————————\\n\\nPicture this: I'm twelve years old and still full into my Twilight phase. I see a commercial for this new movie and roll my eyes be because a movie about children killing eachother doesn't interest me.\\n\\nFlash forward a few months later, hiding under my bed covers into the wee hours of the night reading the book this \\\"weird\\\" movie is based on. Flash forward another few months where I begged my mom to let me attend the midnight premiere of the movie. The rest, as some would say, was history.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games was the first dystopian series I ever got into. It introduced me into the glorious (and sometimes disappointing) world of book adaptations. It truly changed me, which I know is cliche but whatever. At that age I was still cautious of reading. I loved it sure but it was never a full blown obsession (like it is today). So rereading the first book nearly 7/8 years later was a huge eye opener.\\n\\nA lot of years has passed so obviously I came across \\\"better\\\" dystopian books, or just series in general. But for someone reason THG will always hold a special place in my heart.\\n\\nRereading this made me feel all warm and fuzzy which I know shows BAT SHIT CRAZY since the plot of the book literally involves children fighting to the death. I just mean it brings me back to those memories of staying up late and waiting years for the next book/movie to come out. I'm getting to experience falling in love with these characters again.\\n\\nI do want to make something clear though: this book has problems. The writing isn't the best. The characters aren't perfect. You can find better written books out there but honestly? I still love the book.\\n\\nIt was such an important part of my pre/teen years. It ignited the flame that made me fully fall in love with reading.\\n\\nBut obviously I'm older now. Do I have the same view points I did before? Yes...and no. I feel like my viewpoints of these characters has shifted so much and I don't even know why.\\n\\nI love Katniss okay. She is the GIRL ON FIRE. Some say she's whiney and cries too much so obviously she can't be a hero which is a load of bullcrap. Uh, she has to fight to the death with 23 other C H I L D R E N how do you think she would act? I thought she was a good narrator, a good main character.\\n\\nI feel like my biggest change of view has to do with Peeta. I don't want to say I dislike him because I didn't. But...I didn't really love him like the other characters. Why? I was an angsty teen who only cared about TEAM GALE. I was a real mess at that age. I don't know why but this time reading the book I just fell in love with his character. I didn't let my irrational judgement of shipping get in the way. Maybe I just got older and realized that the whole love triangle/TEAM thing was stupid. Me liking him now has nothing to do with \\\"who Katniss should end up with\\\". It just has to do with the fact that I like him. Makes the next two books even more heartbreaking due to all the stuff he goes through.\\n\\nGale...no clue. Who knows why I used to love him AND I DON'T MEAN THAT AS AN INSULT I HAVE ZERO IDEA WHY I LOVED HIM. Maybe the next two books will remind me?\\n\\nPrim. Rue. I just. Children. FREAKING CHILDREN. Everyone in the games were children but these two were actual babies. I will forever be wrecked by what happens to these two.\\n\\nI would go into how insane the games actually are but I'm 99% sure most of you know that.\\n\\nLike I said, THG hold a special place in my heart. Which is why I'm giving it exactly four stars. Not three. Not five. Because while it is a decent book it's not the best and I did have a few problems. But at the same time it brings back to those days. I could almost remember the exact memory of being that age and experiencing this book. Which is a rare thing for me. I barely hold any love for preteen Kayla's taste in books. But this? I think the love will always be there. Quietly lurking in the background as I grow older and my taste in books become more refined. And one day, when I'm old and gray maybe I'll pick this book up and get to live these moments again.\\n\\nUntil then I will let my love lurk in the background. Except this time I won't wait another 8 years to fall back in love with these characters. But even if I do they will still be there. Waiting for me.\"\n",

I was expecting it because I've seen , but I would have appreciated knowing more of the backstory of how the world could have come into such a odd state.\\n\\nI suppose what makes a book like this interesting is thinking about the strategy of it all. The players are going to be statistically encouraged to band together because they will last longer that way, but by definition of course any partnership will be broken, and the drama of how that unfolds is always interesting and full of friendships broken and betrayal. Each character approached the game in their own way. Some banded together in larger coalitions, some were loners initially and banded together later. And some were just loners, like Foxface. A lot depended on your survival skill: could you find food and water on your own? Self-dependence is highly valued - and of course our hero was strong there.\\n\\nAll in all, a fun read, but I feel kind of dirty for having read it.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I think this was an excellent first book to review, especially as it's one the most known YA series out there too. Still, over a decade later, The Hunger Games holds up as very compelling, thought-provoking, as well as entertaining piece of fiction.\\n\\nIn a future dystopian, the world in split into twelve Districts, along with the Capital, who contain all the control and are vastly richer than the rest of their poverty stricken country. As a punishment for attempting to rebel against the Capital, each year, every district must submit two tributes to The Hunger Games - a live televised competition where teenagers aged 12-18 must fight until only one is left alive.\\n\\nI think my favourite thing in general about the book was Katniss Everdeen. She has the flaws of being moody, unsociable, quick-tempered, but she's also very likeable and easy to root for. It's still a quality missed out in protagonists today, despite many authors best efforts. I also appreciated the lack of romance, despite so much of Katniss' survival depending on it.\\n\\nPerhaps what lacked the most was the overall world building. I think I got an appropriate glimpse into the world, but I still would love to find out more, as I did find it interesting. Similarly, the political elements of story were held back for more focus on the Games. However, I do believe this suited The Hunger Games as a standalone book, along with being the first of a trilogy. It's a unique concept to use such popular pieces of popular culture today (reality TV) and twist them into something ripe with violence and cruelty. Overall, the Hunger Games was a very entertaining and fast-paced read. I couldn't find flaws in the structure and do believe Collins made the right choice in focusing primarily on the Games, as that's what many of the readers came for, rather then delving into the equally dangerous world outside of it. It's refreshing to have a book focus completely on the subject content, rather than offer up life lessons that tend to end up being pushed in your face. Collin's subtlety is well-done and does not distract from the plot, which is full twists, gruesome surprises and a satisfying ending.\\n\\nI can't wait to see the next step of Katniss's journey in Catching Fire. It's clear the Games will continue - only now they'll be outside the arena.\"\n",

And may the odds be ever in your favor.\\\"\\n\\nTrigger Warnings: Abandonment, alcoholism, animal death (hunting), blood, death (including parental), depression, gore, murder, parental abuse, PTSD, racism, violence.\\n\\noh. my. . Why did nobody ever tell me this book was so much better than I remembered? I swear I say that every time, but it's true. I always severely underrate this book, but rereading it has reminded me why I love it so, so much. To be clear, I do NOT give my 5 stars freely. (Feel free to check out my reviews to see that I'm telling the truth.) I give a LOT of things 4 stars and maybe even 4.5, but RARELY 5. This book deserves every one of those and 5 more. This is the first book I ever annotated, and it made my reading experience so enjoyable. My books looks so pretty with all these tabs and highlighted sections. (Admittedly, most of them are pink (things I love) or blue (sad things), but it’s still so gorgeous.)\\n\\nObviously, this book is SO classic. It was the first of its kind that everyone heard about. It set the bar INCREDIBLY high, so everything just pales in comparison. Rereading it has shown me why. The plot is BRILLIANT, the characters are fully fleshed out, and the world-building is PHENOMENAL. Panem just feels real, just like the characters. It's like, though you know it's not, it feels like it could be, and that's what counts.\\n\\n\\n\\nCharacter Breakdown:\\n\\nKatniss - I think this quote says enough about Katniss, but Imma keep going.\\nShe is SUCH a bada$$. She is strong. She is brave. She is a warrior. She is a survivor. She is human. Yes, she has her flaws (I mean, HELLO--HUMAN), but it's what makes her so relatable. Yes, she is selfish, but aren't we all to some degree? She knows what she wants and she fights for it. Because of the perspective (first person present), it felt like we were in the Hunger Games with her. There were times it was like I was with her in the tree, I ran with her, I was burned with her. Her pain was mine, but she's such a leader and it's almost like I look up to her. It's a testament to the author's amazing writing.\\n\\nPeeta -\\nCan we just take a moment to appreciate the boy with the bread? PEETAAAA. Oh my gosh. There are no words, none whatsoever. Peeta is just the most interesting, loveable, selfless love interest I have ever met. He does so much out of his love for Katniss, but not in a way that seems selfish or self deprecating. He honestly loves her so much and is just so loveable himself. He's rebellious in his own way. It's not loud, but it's certainly there. How could we not love him to pieces?\\n\\nGale -\\nUnpopular opinion: I love Gale. A lot. While I don't think he is the one for Katniss, he genuinely cares about her and her (and his) family so much and does everything he can to take care of them. Even with the events in and , I still love him. Like Katniss, he makes mistakes (and stupid ones at that), but that's what makes these characters so gosh darn relatable.\\n\\nHaymitch -\\nHonestly though, could anyone ask for a better mentor? Yes, he's a drunk. Yes, he's a pain in everyone's butt. But, could you? The answer is no. He is the king of strategy and methodical thinking. Him and Katniss are so alike which is HILARIOUS because they just banter and DO NOT CLICK. They don't mesh well together which makes their dynamic so humorous. It adds a level of lightness to the Games, while still seeming appropriate.\\n\\nEffie -\\nEffie, oh Effie. I FREAKING LOVE YOU SO FREAKING MUCH. She is so uptight and so Capitol-ish, but I love her and all her pink-headed glory. Some of her dialogue is so funny and she just says things without any thought for others. It's seriously so funny. (As a side note, Elizabeth Banks NAILED Effie in those movies. Best character right here.)\\n\\nCinna -\\nWe need a thousand moments to appreciate this amazing stylist. I'm pretty sure I speak for everyone when I say this is one of the BEST characters in this series and we all need our own Cinna. He just LOVES Katniss to death. But he's seriously so amazing. And that’s not even counting the GORGEOUS dresses he creates. SERIOUSLY like who even is this guy? I just love him with my whole soul and entire being.\\n\\nRue -\\nShe's so young and so innocent. I love her. Her death hits me so hard every. single. time. She alone is a testament to how evil and awful and cruel the Hunger Games are. Sending a twelve year old to her death is hellish and unspeakably horrible.\\n\\nCaesar Flickerman is da BOMB. I love that he tries to help all the tributes and make them look good. He's as good of a person he can be in the Capitol, though it's not his fault he was born and grew up brainwashed. He's not as funny in the books as the movies, though much of that has to do with his facial expressions and laugh on screen. It cracks me up every time. SHOUT OUT TO STANLEY TUCCI for his phenomenal acting.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe romance in this book is so fantastic. It almost doesn't fit into one single trope. It's not slow-burn, fake dating, or love-at-first-sight. It IS slow and it's TECHNICALLY fake dating and (for Peeta) love-at-first-sight, but it's so much more than that. I love seeing the progression of both of their feelings. Even Katniss slowly starts caring for him more and more, even if she won't admit it to herself. The romance is written in a way that doesn't overpower or ruin the plot. If anything, it enhances it. It was written in such a way that it's almost like watching it from the Captiol's perspective while still being in Katniss's head. You fall in love with her, with Peeta, with the audience. At first, their love--every gesture, every word--is staged, but as the story progresses, it becomes more than that and I just melt every time. It's so authentic. It's full of bumps and obstacles and it's messy, but it's so amazing at the same time. It's a completely swoon-worthy romance and it's not even completely real in this book. how phenomenal this writing is. You just feel for these characters 150%.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis book has clearly stood on its own two feet for the last fourteen years and will continue to do so for the next fourteen hundred. It's such a classic and is so timeless and ALWAYS leaves you wanting more. The human characters, the genius plot, the fantastic world-building is only part of it. Her writing is amazing and the lessons and morals you learn from it all top it off. You can be sure that the second book will be in my hands as soon as possible.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"There’s just something about teenage girls taking down totalitarian governments that always gets me\\n\\nI am so mad at myself for not reading this sooner because I’ve loved the movies for such a long time! However I am glad I watched the movies first because it allowed me to picture Jennifer and Josh as Katniss and Peeta.\\nThis is my favorite dystopia of all time. Divergent and The Maze Runner got nothing on The Hunger Games.\\n\\nI don’t think it’s necessary to tell y’all how astonishing the plot is. We all know that already.\\nThe world building here was amazing! I was able to perfectly set these characters in their world. Katniss described every struggle she went through so well. The bread scene? Heartbreaking. It all came together to help me understand what life really was like in this universe. Also, each tribute helped represent their district which really shows how different they all were. The games were also narrated flawlessly. It wasn’t rushed. Every single incident was well written and it was like I was actually in there with her. Or like I was part of the Capitol audience watching her every move and cheering.\\n\\nKatniss is now one of my favorite female main characters of all time. I feel like I should’ve read her journey when I was around 15 years old. She’s extremely clever as she is aware of what the audience wants to see and always makes sure that she gives it to them. Throughout the book she avoids killing except when it comes to self-defense. Even then she feels remorseful. Katniss doesn’t seek fame or fortune, she only wants to go back home. Even throughout the games she remains compassionate as she takes Rue under her wing. She maintains her sense of identity and integrity until the very end. This is why the plot works so well: the human element. Katniss and her “opponents” are simply teenagers fighting for survival. For me, Rue’s fate was the hardest to witness. She is just a child and this fact made me even angrier with the barbarity of the situation.\\n\\nPeeta can be defined by his love for Katniss and compassion. Katniss’s first memory of him proves exactly that. During the games he remains as selfless as ever and doesn’t hesitate to sacrifice himself for her, which isn’t a surprise since he did say at the beginning that his only hope for the Games was to retain his identity. I have to admit I liked his character a lot more in this book than in the movies.\\n\\nThe romance wasn’t the primary focus but it was definitely there and I loved it! Although it is crucial to the story, the main theme of The Hunger Games isn’t the romance. It’s the plot and character development.\\n\\nThis book conveys many important themes. Starting with the most obvious: the inequality between the poor and rich. People with money have all the power and the poor have no choice but to obey. The people of the Capitol know that they have the power and they use it to their advantage. This feels like a very important subject since we can apply it to real life. Some politicians have the same mindsets. They don’t care whose life they ruin as long as they get what they want. In the book the Capitol pretends to care about the districts but they don’t. This inequality is repeatedly mentioned in various ways: starvation being common in some districts while the capitol thrives with feasts; the tessera system.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games also relies on suffering for entertainment. For the Capitol, the more the tributes suffer (physically and psychologically) the better. It is mentioned many times that the viewers want to see the tributes fighting each other. They don’t want a quick death because then the entertainment would be over. This is very clear because once the mutations get Cato he isn’t killed immediately. They want to make him suffer first. Even the romance between Katniss and Peeta that is so loved by the audience shows this. They are, after all, the “star-crossed lovers”. Their romance is doomed from the beginning and that’s what makes it so entertaining.\\n\\nIf you’ve never seen the movies you would assume that at the end of this book the worst is over when in reality it’s just beginning. Katniss tricked the Capitol which no one ever dared to do before. This book will leave you extremely excited for the next two.\\n\\nFinally, the book ends up being a huge anti-violence trope. The games and the government are a way of portraying how violence and brutality destroy everything good about human life. This is a story about self-sacrifice and how love can overcome cruelty. I recommend this book to everyone!\"\n",

Once a year, in a dystopian future, an oppressive, ruling district randomly picks 2 kids, ages 12-18 from each district to compete in the Hunger Games, which is a battle to the death. 24 kids start, one survives and his/her district receives additional rations for a year. This year, Catnis's 12 year old sister is chosen who would surely be killed. Catnis volunteers to take her place and we fall in love with her. The boy chosen, Peta, has been secretly in love with her for years. Only one of the two of them can survive. No matter how Peta figures it, his relationship with Catnis must perish.\\n\\n\\n\\nGood: Collins sets up an interesting and convincing world of brutal oppression. Catnis is a great character and all of the people in the story are interesting. It's first person POV and we really do find Catnis likeable. It's hard to imagine a novel of teens killing one another to be palatable. This in itself is a major achievement. There are, of course, the villians (the oppressors) and the favored contestants (from districts 1 and 2), which makes Catnis an underdog. We like underdogs. We also like Catnis's skill at archery. Collins does a great job pitting Catnis and Peta against one another in a fight to the death in spite of the fact that Peta has loved her since he was very young.\\n\\nThe people who live as aristocrats in \\\"the capitol\\\" come off as likeable, if affected, because they empathize with and try their best to support Catnis and Peta in this game to the death.\\n\\nA lot of the killings are inventive and Catnis is properly challenged beyond her abilities and is a winner. The plot moves well and the ending feels earned. This novel is a story of survival and Collins maintains that tension throughout. The intertwined love story is uncomplicated but interesting.\\n\\nNot as good: We don't see much soul searching on the page. The love story and issue of surviving is emotionally captivating. But a little more depth in Catnis would have put the cherry on top.\\n\\n\\n\\nBottom line: You've probably already seen the movie. The novel is better than the movie although the movie is very faithful to the novel. I reread this novel to read a woman's first person POV for the purposes of the writing I'm doing. What surprised me is how well the novel holds up on second reading and after seeing the movie. So, it's a thumb's up!\"\n",

This is what I thought of it:\\n\\n\\n\\nPlenty of people, particularly people closer to my age, in their twenties, don't care for this book, or say the one person POV is limiting, or they hate the addition of romance, or they hate the lack of romance, or etc etc, you've heard it all.\\n\\nI was not one of those people. Before this book, I was kind of sporadically reading books, a sort of rare occasion thing, and at the most I could do about 20 pages a night, but that was a stretch. But then I started reading this, and every single chapter left off with a reason to go on to the next one, and I found myself staying up til 2 in the morning with this book even though I had to be up by 7, and I just could not get over how entertained and on edge I was. And yes, I had been a long time fan of Battle Royale already, but this still felt like something fresh and special, more intimate.\\n\\nAh well anyway. Just simply my sappy diatribe to explain that this is the book that made me want to READ books again. And I have not stopped my reading momentum since.

Katniss was shown as a Human able to retain her humanity even while she is forced into inhuman circumstances. She is shown as stronger of her companions because while they start killing each other like anymals from the beginning she manages to avoid pointless bloodletting.\\nAnd, let's consider the following: who is stronger, the ones who basically bow to the will & whimsy of the Kapitol and kill each other for the public fun or Katniss who while forced into the same situation as the rest of them refuses to be a puppet and kills only when she absolutely has to. My vote is for Kstniss here, both hands up.\\n\\n\\nThe movie was INCREDIBLE! The two salute sceenes: #1) 'I volunteer as tribute!' & #2) Salute of District 11 are immensely powerful!\\nGreat film!

It hit me like a brick the first time and it still has an impact on me.\\n-the first 60 seconds of the Games, when they are waiting for it to start. SO MUCH TENSION!\\n-Katniss screaming Peeta's name when she hears that there can be 2 winners.\\n-chapter 19 (or really every scene of the two in the cave).\\nFeel free to comment and share with me the love for this book and may the odds be ever in your favor.\"\n",

Often these types of stories fall into cliche, but the concept of revolution against an oppressive power starting within a system designed to maintain control is ingenious.\\n\\nI just watched Maze Runner (have not read the book) and was not impressed. Nor with Divergent. But this book, and the first movie, touched on deeper subjects.\\n\\nI think any totalitarian regime eventually fails. And government that has an elite with most of the resources has a built in failure. Because people are equal.\\n\\nI've heard that the concept of the games themselves was done in another book from Japan-- possible, but also, as a writer, I know every idea has been done. Not every story. The two are not the same. My wife and I, who write together, came up with the idea for Burners quite a while ago. The same basic concept of a regime tilted toward one small group, ruling over the masses. It could be with money, a system we see in our country now with most of the wealth clustered in less than 1% or, as we speculate in burners, in time-- what is worse than an inequality in lifespan?\\n\\nThe very title of this book-- Hunger Games-- indicates that when one takes from another, you leave them hungry-- whether for food, freedom, or simply time.\"\n",

Where you're afraid it's filled with viciousness and that the pages will haunt you or make you cry.  Because that's where I was.  But my lovely blog buddy, Chelsea, pushed me out of my comfort zone.  She bought me this trilogy and then after I still hadn’t read it, she organized a buddy read with five other of our friends.  There was no backing out after that.  While I was always morbidly curious what all the hype was about, I decided to plunge head first and hope that I'd make it out while clinging onto my sanity.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.    First and foremost Katniss is one of the main reasons I fell in love with this book. She's a survivor who stepped up and is the sole reason her family is alive and didn't starve to death after her father died.  I respected how much responsibility she took on at a young age and how it morphed her into a determined, tough woman.  But she isn't just a hunter and provider.  She's a good friend to her best friend and fellow hunter, Gale.  And she is like a second mom to her little sister, Prim.  It was easy to like Katniss and to sympathize with her.  Especially when she stepped up and volunteered to take her sister's place in The Hunger Games.\\n\\n2.    The way the story is delivered makes it easy to fall into their world.  The details are enough to get a good grasp on everything, but never to the point where it is overwhelming or will bore you.  It honestly reads as though I was having a movie play in my head.\\n\\n3.  It was impossible to put this book down.  There was so much going on that I had to know what would happen next.  And when I did have to put this book down due to life, boo, the scenes kept replaying in my head.  I kept trying to guess what was going to happen next, and it became all consuming!\\n\\n4.  Peeta, her fellow district competitor, constantly had my attention and I struggled with how to view him.  At times he could appear so selfless and heartfelt and other times he would appear cold, calculating and a true opponent.  He will keep you intrigued and make you want to learn more about him.  Because in one moment he'll be melting your heart and other times he will turn it to ice!  I loved Peeta because I'm twisted like that ha!\\n\\n5.    I was terrified that my palms would never stop being sweaty or that my stomach would constantly be twisted in horror.  And I'm not going to lie, I was an emotional wreck.  I sobbed quiet a few times and it was hard to catch my breath at other times.  I never knew if there was ever going to be a break in the insanity that is their lives.  But when I read that final page, it was worth all of the emotional pain.  Because the story that unfolded, is one that will stick with me.  Even in the darkest moments of The Hunger Games, I was struck by the sincerity of some of their interactions.  Even when they were at their worst, people kept surprising me and gave me faith in humankind.\\n\\n\\nAnd I'm already counting the seconds until I can pick up the second book.  Good luck, and may the odds be in your favor.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe used to make Anna’s picture can be found .\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"So the long and the short of it: the gf wanted to see the movie version at the infamous \\\"film on the rocks\\\"--once a week they showcase a film at red rocks amphitheater in morrison colorado, with a live band and stand-up comedian. I just couldn't be \\\"one of those guys\\\" that hasn't read the popular book that almost every other human from my socio-economic background has read and be even more out of touch with popular culture than I already am--I am just now, thanks to the tireless efforts of the gf to make me less \\\"obscure\\\", catching on to \\\"she's the man\\\" references that have flown completely beneath my radar.\\n\\nDo you like cheese?\\n\\nSo, I figured that twenty hours would be plenty of time to lick this slim entry in preteen pop culture. It was more than enough time. Did you know this is a YA novel AND features the brutal murder of children? I think that was what took me aback the most in this book--nearly every character is completely DGAF* about stabbing, shooting, dismembering, poisoning, and drugging their fellow competitors.\\n\\nIs this some kind of political allegory?\\n\\nIf so, then so is gladiator, and no where in the hunger games, do we get heroic roman names like \\\"maximus decimus meridius leader of the armies of the north\\\"; instead, there are things like peeta bread and catnip which seemed almost intentionally strange and obscure to me, but then again, so do all names in the fantasy genre.\\n\\nI don't want to say that this book was bad, because it went so quickly and thus could not have made me feel uncomfortable per se (twss), and I don't think it's \\\"badly written\\\" necessarily. I mean, it's no Nabokov, let's be real, but it serves its purpose. It has a tightly constructed plot that eschews a lot of exposition in favor of fast pacing and action. And I'm sure that that was what grabbed most of the readers and that's what's responsible for its runaway success, and it's certainly responsible for me getting through nearly three pages in a minute while reading it the night before the movie. On those grounds, I can't really knock it down or condescend like I would twilight or fifty shades etc. etc. So I'm forced to sneer at it across the room as all the other kids make conversation with it and have a good old time, not that I'm being intentionally reclusive here, just that it didn't really do much of anything for me.\\n\\nAnd that is not even a legitimate complaint given the dreadful state of my \\\"read\\\" books this year. I'm happy to have padded my shelf just a bit.\\n\\nIs that good enough for a four star rating?\\n\\nMaybe. Probably not. I did, however, enjoy the movie, simply on the grounds that in the book, the prose was ultra dull and thus did not supply nearly as enough entertainment dopamine (ED) to my brain as the explosive, constant-shaky-cam of the movie. And with the movie, we are broken out of the limitations of the catnip first person. The movie gives us a broader scope of the hunger games world, which (with the help of the always loveable woody harrelson) handled the politics of a futuristic, corporate-controlled world quite well. In the book, all the writing that doesn't include the fighting and senseless murder of children, mostly consists of catnip explaining everything that has already happened in the book (in case you were too dull to pick up on the already obvious and easy-to-digest plot, or you just weren't paying attention (me))and her complaining how she's too cold or too hungry.\\n\\nRiveting stuff.\\n\\n*another pop culture term I picked up from the gf meaning \\\"doesn't give a fuck\\\" and apparently works just fine as an adjective like that, as do the words: \\\"nast\\\", \\\"presh\\\", \\\"totes presh\\\", \\\"adorbs\\\", and of course the ever lovable and excessive \\\"totes presh adorbs\\\".\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"To be completely honest, I didn't love this book as much as I expected to. This book is obviously one of the most popular YA dystopians out there right now and I expected to like it more than I did. But, I still did really enjoy this book. I know I'm years behind and I should have read this a long time ago but I'm just getting around to it now! This is the first book I read for this years Booktubeathon, and it's for the challenge of starting and finishing a trilogy and a book to movie adaption. I finished this book in a few hours which I am extremely proud of (cause I never do) and I watched the movie too.\\n\\nThe biggest problem I had with this book was the fact that it doesn't really make sense. The reason why The Hunger Games even exists is ridiculous. To remind people how horrible the war was? That's the reason why they kill 23 teenagers every year? It seems very illogical and unrealistic. And why does it have to be kids between the ages of 12-18? Why those specific ages? Why can't adults compete? Also, how did this even become a thing? Because I can't imagine everyone would willingly sign up to be brutally murdered in The Hunger Games. I just want more of an explanation as to why it exists and how it came about.\\n\\nThis book started off kind of slow for me. I liked it, but it wasn't addictive. I rolled my eyes a couple of times when something predictable and cliche happened. To be completely honest I didn't feel a lot of chemistry between Katniss and Peeta, it felt kind of forced. (I know it technically was \\\"forced\\\" but you know what I mean.) I really like her relationship with Gale though because it felt more natural. I loved all the sabotage and sacrifice that took place during the Hunger Games though. Like the scenes with the wasp nest and in the caves, they were my favorite! The ending was a bit awkward for me. But I liked this book enough to finish it in one day so that should tell you something.\\n\\nI know people are probably sick of the comparisons, but I liked Divergent a lot more than The Hunger Games. People only compare them because they are both extremely popular YA dystopian trilogy's that are becoming movies, but I'm just putting my opinion out there. I enjoyed Divergent a lot more than this one.\"\n",

I could reread this book a million times and still love it the same as I did when I first read it!\\n\\nREREAD #1\\nWow. Again I read this in one whole day👀 a SCHOOL day at that. It’s weird how fast this book goes by! And it’s 450+ pages!! So believe it or not I actually have new thoughts on this book. (Haha I just looked at my original review. I lied😂) And yes I lowered it to four stars.\\n\\n1) this wasn’t as enjoyable as reading it this first time. Don’t get me wrong it was emotional to reread it! So many memories of experiencing it for the first time. But what’s weird was I prefer the movie this time around👀😬🤔 I remember reading this for the first time then watching the movie and hating the movie. Because it was so different. I rewatched it and realized ok they are actually amazing. But honestly now I realize the movies stayed pretty true to the books.\\nit’s been 1 year and 3 months since I read this book for the first time. And honestly I really disliked Katniss’ character in the book!👀 She is stubborn and strong in the movie but she is weak and more humorous in the book. I was mad they made such a change to her in the movies but I’ve grown more fond of movie Katniss then this Katniss. Anyone else feel the same?\\n\\n2) I didn’t feel as attached to the characters in this book. I’ve grown to know the movies so well and how they are in there that I realized most of them are a bit different in the books. And I used to be so upset about that but now I prefer their movie selves.\\n\\n3) somehow, even though I still rerated it four stars, I was a bit disappointed in the end. It felt different then the first time reading it and well it was strange. Probably because I got so accustomed to the movies. But it all felt off and so did Katniss’s character. I didn’t remember being like this. It also didn’t feel as Hunger Games-like. Or as intense and action packed. This one literally felt like a YA Romance with a bit of dystopia. Idk it felt a bit off reading it this time. Of course I still love this series though❤️ And I’m excited to read Catching Fire because I do remember it being better than the first in the books as well as the movies.\"\n",

It was like the author just wanted to write some book about a bunch of teenagers killing each other lord-of-the-flies style, but couldn't think of a good reason why the characters would be doing so. The explanation was really vague, like, \\\"The government is forcing people to do this because they want to ... show their power ...\\\" ??? Doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Also, after you read about a bunch of kids killing each other in horrible ways, it's just plain depressing. Then it gets boring and repetitive, after it keeps happening for like a hundred pages.\\n\\nI liked the emotional/romantic aspect of it. It was interesting. I thought it could've used a little more development, maybe, but it was cute.\\n\\nI guess my main issue with it was the plot, because it seemed to run out of plot about halfway through. It started falling into repetition ... and then the end was just WEIRD. *** spoiler **** and by that i mean the thing w/everyone turning into werewolves ... WTF was w/that??!! ***spoiler over****\\n\\nAnd, like, there's supposed to be a sequel? About what ... ? I mean, I guess there's a few details that could be worked out, but really it would've been better if they had been tied up in the end of the first book. Is the sequel worth reading? Yeah ...

As much as that's what it centers around, that is not the purpose of the book.\\n\\nI respect this book, a lot even. I feel bad that I didn't give it a chance until I decided to read it. I brushed it off as if it was just another mainstream book, and expected it to be full of things I didn't want to read.\\nBut it wasn't, and I am so glad. No swearing, and no inappropriate scenes. It was clean.\\n\\nI have to say, as more and more popular the dystopian genre is becoming, this is quite a unique book.\\n\\nI didn't find it overly gory or disgusting, really, because come on, this is a book with lots of deaths and I expected it to be heavily described. I was prepared for that, though it didn't end up being that way very much. Some of the TV shows I watch are much more violent than this is, really.\\n\\nAnd like I said, as much as death is a central characteristic, the books aren't about the killing.\\n\\nMurder is NEVER portrayed as right. Neither Katniss nor Peeta ever want to kill anyone. Katniss is a girl with high morals. She's self-sacrificing. For goodness sake, she took her sister's place in The Games, and was absolutely ready to die for her. She sees the evil of the Capitol and hates it. She's modest and has a pure heart, and puts her family first before anything or anyone else.\\n\\nAnd although she doesn't love Peeta romantically in this book, he earns her begrudging respect. She learns what his love for her looks like, and doesn't intentionally take advantage of that - she grows to love him as a friend.\\n\\nI enjoyed this book because it blew my expectations away. I didn't know this before I started it, but THG is not about the killing. It's about doing what's right even if you could die for it. It's about making the most of what you've been given, and never giving up even when it's difficult.\\n\\nThe writing was unique. Collins uses a lot of fragments in her writing, but it works. It's down-to-earth, and not stiff at all.\\n\\nI don't understand why people say that Katniss is cold. She cares deeply about her mother and her sister Prim. She cares about Gale and about Peeta, and Cinna, and Haymitch and Effie too. She's scared, yeah. But not for herself. She's scared for everyone that she would leave behind when she doesn't come back. But of course, she does come back. And they need her.\\n\\nIt's not a Christian book, but it's still a good book. A book that I respect and will definitely read again.\"\n",

It's a fun dystopia joyride from start to finish that pushes the boundaries of what you can get away with when dealing with adolescent characters. The adult themes are so strong in this one that I often forget that these weren't adults we're dealing with. Rue seems to be the only character that comes off undeniably as a small child, so anything related to her comes off extra unsettling. This tale of survival in a cruel world is bound to have a lasting effect on the reader.\\n\\nI saw the movie years ago, so I knew what I was getting myself into. I figured the book would get more graphic than a movie could, and I was right in that regard. I'm going into book 2 completely blind to experience it for the first time in its proper format.

      "      \"review\": \"The Hunger Games is set in the post apocalyptic future. As way of controlling/punishing the small districts around the Capital, the Hunger Games are created. Each of the 12 Districts have to offer one boy and one girl aged 12-18 to take part in a televise fight to the death. Katniss Everdeen, takes her younger sisters place in the games. Rule is survival kill or be killed.\\n\\nI liked the fact that Katniss was a hunter before she was chosen so she has experience in killing and survival training. The thing I did not like about the book is that many of Katniss, escapes are more dumb luck or stupidity of the others part, example once she is cornered so she climbs a tree one of her particular pursuers is very good with a spear another with throwing knives but they choose to climb after her then failing that wait at the bottom for her. Also for someone who is supposed to be very unlikeable, Katniss seem to have the ability to draw people towards her. She is supposed to be from the poorest district, yet she draws the best sponsors, the best designer and gains the best marks. For an underdog story she seems more born and bred for the Hunger Games then most of the \\\"Career Tributes\\\" (boys and girls usually from the richer districts volunteering and usually winning the games).\\n\\nI heard this was endorsed by Stephenie Meyer, I would think this is because of the love triangle that appears. The book is an easy read it flows very well, and the pages do fly by. There are fewer fights then I expected the very brutal injuries and deaths. All in all I am not blown away by the first book, but as i bout the trilogy together I will go straight on to the next book.\"\n",

I've been obsessed with her since I first read this series years ago. There's just something different about her. Like the way she was so willingly to\\nor how cool she is with her bow and arrow.\\n\\nIf it weren't for her, I probably wouldn't love this series as much as I do.\\n\\nPeople are sometimes confused when I tell them this is my comfort series. They're like \\\"bUt ItS sO vIoLenT\\\" or \\\"bUt ItS sO sAd\\\"\\n\\nYes, people die, and yes, The Hunger Games is probably one of the most depressing books ever. But I don't love it because of that. I love it because of the characters. And not only Katniss. Gale, Cinna, Effie, Haymitch, Rue, Finnick, Johanna... the list goes on and on. They are all just so well written and each have something unique about them that really makes them stand out to me.\\n\\nNow, don't get me wrong. The rest of the book is excellent as well. The writing is great. The plot is phenomenal. But the characters... you can't beat them.\\n\\nSo if you're having doubts about reading this book because it's sad, or violent, or just because you've heard bad things about it, read it for the characters.

      "      \"review\": \"This is a YA. This is a YA. This is a YA...\\n\\nWhile reading this book, I was repeating that as a mantra to remind me that I have to be shallow (mababaw) so that my P759 (courtesy of my 13th month pay) would not go to waste. This book was recommended by a couple of a Filipino teens in our blog here in Goodreads as January's Book of the Month. I also heard 89.9 Magic's Mo Twister raving about this in his morning program as his book-for-the-holiday break. As I always listen to him in my way to the office in the morning, I did not want to be left out so what the hell, why not buy and read this book.\\n\\nIt is a gripping and a edge-of-the-seat futuristic escapist novel. It rides in the current wave of reality shows. Think of the Survivor but the participants are teenagers (12 to 18 boys and girls) killing each other in the wilderness - forest, in the book's batch. That fighting in the forest readily reminded me of another fiction - historical, this time - that I read last year: Ken Follett's (1996) and I liked it. It reminds me of our vacations in the barrio where we lived by eating the fruits and vegetables straight from our farm and we had no electricity so we either read books while the sun was still up late in the afternoon or play cards using a homemade kerosene lamp. Cool.\\n\\nAnyway, there's a handful reasons why this is not getting a five star: First, is the unbelievable plot. For example, Thresh letting go of Katriss. Collins made a good excuse by saying about \\\"owing\\\" and that Thresh, if he wins, will have to go back to District 11 and explain about killing Katriss at that point. He would be killing her later anyway, so what is the point? Second, is the corny beauty pageant show complete with floats, interview portion and makeup. Third, is the cheesy love story. It reminds me of the tiring Twilight love triangle. Fourth, is the fact that the Hunger Games is a sick reality TV show viewed by the whole country. What I cannot understand is how come the country (most of the districts cannot afford to feed their citizens) is so poor but the Capitol can afford to provide high tech TV screen that can be viewed even inside a cave and monitors even when Peeta was deep in the mud or when Rue was right on top of a tree? Lastly, the man and boys in the novel are morons and wimpy while the girls (Katriss, Rue, Foxface) all rock! Is this because the author is a woman and most reading population (according to statistics)are women?\\n\\nAnyway, enough of what I hate about the book. For entertainment value (I finished reading the book in 2 days even working 8 hours each in the office) it gave me, I already bought the 2nd book - CATCHING FIRE (o, savings will have to wait) and I will be reading this in the next few weeks. I cannot wait to find what happens next to Katriss and who she will be ending up with - Gale or Peeta. LOL.\"\n",

I seriously couldn't stop reading, and was constantly waiting for what happens next!\\n\\n*⁀➷ Katniss: I love Katniss so, so much. She has an overall pretty stiff, and ruthless character, but in so many parts of the book we were still shown that she is very much human. She's smart, she's brave, and she cares so, so much about the people she loves. Although she can be 𝘲𝘶𝘪𝘵𝘦 oblivious at times. She is also so strong and definitely knows how to survive.\\n\\n➸ Peeta: Peeta is so incredibly sweet, but also knows how to fend for himself, and overall I just loved him, even though i thought he was a teeny bit annoying at times.\\n\\n➸ The Love Triangle: I think we all know about my opinion on love triangles. I can't stand them. And there are sooo many.\\nThere's really not much to say about this one yet, since not much happened. I'm assuming it's going to be explored more in the next books. That's also something that I really liked about the book. There was a romance plot, but it wasn't the main thing, and the book didn't only consist of Katniss swooning over two guys. Yay!\\nOverall, the triangle basically consisted of Katniss' mixed feelings for Peeta, and worrying about what she's gonna do if she has to kill him, and comparing him to Gale.

When Katniss Everdeen’s twelve-year-old sister’s name is drawn for the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place, and is thus drawn into a horrifying and desperate fight for survival against the odds, the elements, and her fellow, bloodthirsty competitors.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Hunger Games pulled me into its dangerous world and captivated every inch of me. I was at the edge of my seat, the whole time reading this book. when I was finally finished and turned the last page, I drew out the breath I was holding and screamed - WoW.\\n\\n\\n\\nI loved Katniss as a protagonist. She is strong, ruthless, intelligent, independent and bold. She doesn't hesitate to do whatever needs to be done. Katniss is practical and responsible. At the first glance, one would kind her heartless. But as the story progresses, the author highlights some vulnerability inside her. Katniss isn't as immune to feelings and emotions as it might seem. But when living is similar to fighting in a battle, who has got time to 'feel' ?\\n\\nKatniss's unconditional love for her little sister humanizes her stiff characters. She loves her sister dearly. We notice her cold demeanour slipping away when she is with her or talking about her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPeeta Malik is exactly the kind of hero I like. He is gentle, caring, sweet, funny and charming. But he is also very intelligent, compassionate, responsible and has amazing survival skills. He can't really fight but has a brain of a master mind. One can't help but praise his cleverness and calculated moves. He is charming and romantic. Everyone likes Peeta as soon as they meet him. Peeta is your classic cinnamon roll hero with a very very crafty mind.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe action sequences are amazing. Most of the YA books doesn't go into details of an action scene. But that's not the case here. All the action scenes are crafty and detailed. The book handles some efficiently dark themes and contains gore details which can be triggering for some readers. But I personally didn't face any problems. Everything was almost perfect. The suspense is continuous throughout the book, right until the very end, and it leaves the reader wanting to know more about Katniss and her story.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have heard a lot of complains about the romance in The Hunger Games series. Specifically *the love triangle*, (cough cough). So you all know my perspective on love triangles. I hate them unless they are done immaculately. I basically went to this book expecting to hate the romance. But surprise! I really didn't. Infact I enjoyed it a lot. Don't know how this is gonna turn out in the later two instalments but what we have got in this one- is amazing. Call Katniss a heartless bitch, I can totally understand why she did what she did. When your lives are at stake, you have to be ruthless sometimes. This book is dark and unconventional; the romance is no different from the story itself. Dang! did I love it. I did. Can't wait to read the next book.\\n\\nThank you for recommending me this series. Your recommendations are the best.\\n.........................》《..........................\\n\\n\\nI might be the only person here who's yet to read I guess it's time....👀\\n\\nAnd says this series is amazing. She loves it; it's apparently one of her favorites. We have similar taste in books, so I am counting on her recommendation. Let's hope I love it as much as she does. Finger crossed...🤞🤞🤞\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"After a few years, I thought I might change my mind and give this a better rating as that has been happening to me recently. I have been seeing the books I had previously rated in a new light and providing a different rating either lower or higher. Unfortunately (or fortunately) I am still stuck in the same rating. I am yet to love this book despite the fact that it carries a heavier message to society. Also, I recently found out that a few schools have been recommending this as part of their reading list, which made me contemplate more about the message and try to comprehend what the children attain from reading the book.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, we need to remember that The Hunger Games was released during the YA fever that was the rage of that time. Furthermore, Hunger Games ticked off another book that was dystopian literature. Dystopian literature on its own can start a whole new conversation. A thought that always flitted through my head was 'Why do children have to read such harrowing books?' and the answer I always come up with is 'They need to see that the world is not the beautiful place they think it is'. But now that I am older and I see my younger cousins and other children, a part of me doesn't want their brains to be muddled with all of these angry thoughts I carry around against people of power, our ancestors and everything that has brought us to this point. These conflicting thoughts kept arising again in my head whilst reading Hunger Games. We are thrown into a world where the power balance hangs in a precarious grip and the oppressed are at their lowest. Throughout the book, we see one young girl igniting the flame in everyone's hearts. She becomes the beacon of a rebellion. Her actions alone jump starts the beginning of the fight to get back their freedom.\\n\\nIn a way, it makes sense that the protagonist herself is a teenager as the book is actually for teenage readers and they can fully understand her. There's also a sprinkling of romance to make it more desirable for teenagers to read. A little hint here and there of a love triangle but that does not change the key takeaway of the story, that this is a rebellion against those who abused their power and left the others to suffer.\\n\\nDystopia as some say, is the opposite of utopia. But is it really? In my mind, dystopia and utopia need to exist together at the same time. One cannot exist without the other. In the perfect utopia, there are many dystopian realities but in the perfect dystopia, there is only one utopia. Collins does a brilliant job conveying this through Panem. We see the suffering of the 12 districts, especially the last 8 and the splendour in which the people of the capitol live. We see it through Katniss's eyes. We see her stand up against everything they are making her do. She refuses to be a part of their sadist games. Thus in the fires, the Mockingjay is born. The symbolism the book carries is heavy as we are reminded over and over again of what the tiny singing bird represents. What begins as a simple fight for her survival ends up being a fight for the survival of humanity. We are also reminded that it was these children that brought that spark, that it was not the adults in the society who managed to stand against all these inhuman actions against them. We see the adults hiding behind her, using her as a beacon. Through their actions, we see that the rebellion was not just born overnight when Katniss entered the game. It was brewing in their hearts for a long time and she was that spark they needed.\\n\\nIn the end, the message is subtly delivered in this first book of the trilogy. We are given a glimpse of what we would see in the future. A full rebellion in power. More lives lost more lives conflicts, and destruction of lives without actually killing them (Sometimes murder seems more merciful) and we readers are at the mercy of the capitol as much as the characters. It could be that I am really trying hard to see some kind of semblance with our current society but why does it seem like I can't see much difference? Call me a pessimistic but I see the future humanity heading towards the same destruction. Maybe we won't throw a bunch of children into the killing field and tell them to kill themselves but we might as well do with all the destruction we see simply caused by power-hungry leaders. I always wonder, are we too late to stop the destruction that humanity is heading? Should we keep our head down and wait till a Katniss show up or should we take a stance?\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Began to read this on Friday evening after 'mastermind' at 830pm and before the great comedy that is 'twentytwelve' at 10pm. It shows how much I got into it that I almost opted to not turn the tv on again at 10pm. Praise indeed Ms Collins.\\n\\nThis has a simple storyline. Twelve divisions of a post apocalyptic country, defeated decades before in an attempt at revolution, are punished annually by a tribute. This monstrosity is to provide two children between the ages of 12 and 18, male and female, to fight it out in a battle to the death where only one of the 24 survives. This spectacle serves to remind the 12 oppressed states that they are under the rule of the 'Capitol', the ruling power. Our heroine takes the place of her beloved sister and ends up accompanying into this horror a young lad of her own age of whom she knows nothing except she begins to realize that he has flitted in the background of her life in a number of unobtrusive ways. Questions of trust, of truth, of fidelity to self and of preparadness to sacrifice fly back and forth. What is it to be real, to be genuine ? Is it more important to survive at all costs no matter what you give up to do so, or is the real you unalloyed goodness.\\n\\nThis is not great literature in the sense that my great grandchildren, were I against all odds to gain some, are highly unlikely to be reading this but Collins has created a world which is horrendously believeable. A callous disregard for justice and compassion, a situation in which ratings and the visual are far more important than the twisted logic or vicious cruelty which went into their construction, a superficiality which can enable moodswings because of a pretty face or a heartstring tugging storyline..........sound familiar ? Collins has cleverly shone a light on stardom and celebrity and puerile shows in which the eating of a kangaroo's bollocks are seen as high drama and taken it far beyond what even those shows would envisage but she has left enough of the gaudy tackiness draped in soiled, tattered embarrassment to make her point.\\n\\nI found the story totally enthralling. Unusually for me I did not retch at the insertion of the inevitable 'love interest' purely because in Collins' story it was not inevitable. It was not the ridiculously badly written love at first sight crap ....yes Pittacus Lore, you know who you are....that is sometimes inflicted upon the unwary traveller. The two main characters were people you felt for and were rooting for. Collins managed to move me over the death of totally minor characters and the expressions of loving support that came each time Katniss showed her humanity and her kindness was genuinely startling.\\n\\nDoes anymore need to be said. Enthralling, exciting and very 'page-turnery'\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I watched the movie before reading this book and I loved both the movie and this book. Since this review is about the book, I'll try to stick to that only.\\n\\nThis is based hundreds of years from now in the future where President Snow rules Panem which is divided into thirteen Districts and The Capitol. Districts are based on different occupations, some are poor and some are wealthy. District 12 where our MC is from is mining business and is a poor district. Every year Capitol sends for choosing a teenager girl and a boy from each of the twelve Districts as District 13 is not active anymore and then the chosen ones fight in the arena in The Capitol to survive and to entertain The Capitol's residents. All the action from the arena is telecasted live even in the Districts. The one who wins lives life of luxury including his/her family for the rest of their lives.\\n\\nKatniss, she's unapologetic and fierce. She's stellar with a bow. She's the older sister and loves her younger sister the most in the world. She volunteers to fight in the arena when her sister Primrose is chosen. She's more on the quiet side. I didn't like her character as much as I had wanted to in this book but she lived up to all the hype I'd say.\\n\\nPeeta happens to be one of my favourite characters and he's chosen alongside Katniss to fight in the arena. Peeta is creative, witty and kind. He's also secretly in love with Katniss.\\n\\nGale, well not much to him except that he's good looking and Katniss's best friend. Also, they both like each other but don't say it. I didn't really get much of him to say whether I liked him or not.\\n\\nHaymitch is also among my favourite characters in the book. He's sarcastic, witty, fun, drunk and he won The Hunger Games when he was a teenager. He's also the last person to win from District 12. He just makes this book so much more interesting and entertaining for me. His one liners cracked me up.\\n\\nIn the arena, only one person is supposed to survive at the end. When in the end, both Peeta and Katniss survive and it is expected for only one of them to survive, Katniss decides to end both their lives instead of giving Capitol the satisfaction of playing by the rules. In the arena, she also kinda falls for Peeta.\\n\\nI loved this book, it really did give the dystopian vibes instead of just saying dystopia. And it definitely lived up to all the hype. I was not even once disappointed. It was completely action-packed. I also loved Effie and Cinna.\\n\\n4.5 stars\"\n",

I recently reread it, and the whole time I was thinking, \\\"I get why I love this, I get why it is so popular, but it is just not a five star book.\\\"\\n\\nWhy do I say that?\\n\\nThe writing. It's just not that strong. This is told in first-person present tense, which is not particularly forgiving to the writer. It's a bit jarring and it occasionally makes for some grammatical structures. Then there's Katniss's voice, which is so \\\"straight-to-the-point\\\" that it's a bit ridiculous. The writing is sparse, and not in a starkly beautiful way. It's just a bit bare bone.\\n\\nBut this is still a great book! The story is compelling, as are the characters, and the way it depicts relationships is just A+.\\n\\nI LOVE the fact that Katniss doesn't immediately have a love interest in this book! Personally, based on what we see on the page, Katniss reads as queer. Obviously, that's subtext. But still. I really like that in one of the biggest YA blockbusters, the female protagonist is NOT driven primarily by her romantic feelings. Romance stories in YA aren't inherently bad, they're just so ubiquitous that it's worth commenting when that the case. There's \\\"romance\\\" here, but it's performative (which is also a pretty cool commentary on what consumers expect to see when it comes to young adult stories).\\n\\nI should also mention that the names in this are UTTERLY ridiculous. The boy with the bread. Is named. Pita.\"\n",

It was just an okay book, something I had read, but had no feelings about it. I thought the same about other two books from the series. I also watched the movies, when they came out, but they were also just okay.\\n\\n\\nI don't know what I expected to feel when I picked again, but I definitely did not expect to fall in love with it so strongly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I first read this book, I didn't like Katniss. She had been too serious, too distant and too suspicious of everyone. Back then I didn't understood her character at all. But now I understand. How could she be different than serious, distant and suspicious if she had been born and raised in such an incredibly evil world? She lost her childhood. She had to become mature for the sake of her sister and her mother after her father died. She had to provide for them, because there was no one else who would. She had been brave, so brave, even before she stepped into the arena of the Hunger Games. But the moment was the most brave thing she had done. She loved her little sister so much that she had been willing to die for her. And she fought with tooth and nails to go back to her. She was a true badass - not just as a Hunger Games fighter, but also as a sister, as a daughter, as a friend and as a lover. And with that she became one of my favorite book characters.\\n\\n\\nP.S. the only thing I didn't like about her this time was her constant mentioning of Gale. Girl, you have a perfect boyfriendright by your side and you compare him to another??\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nO my God, Peeta Mellark is a perfection. A perfect boyfriend material. Oh wait, even better - a better husband material! I had fallen for him from the moment he gave Katniss the bread (of course) and since then I had fallen for him more and more. I would have fallen for him even if I had no knowledge about the next books. Katniss was suspicious of him, thought that he is playing a role, but he didn't. Everything he had done, every decision he had made was for Katniss. He knew that he would die in the arena, because he decided that Katniss had to be a winner. Katniss had to survive. And with that thought he fought with all his might. And he was ready to die for her on the end. How could anyone hate this guy? How? He deserves everything best, if I could give it to him, I would in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI cried for Rue. I cried for Tresh. I cried for Foxface. For Glimmer. I also cried for Clove and Cato. Katniss had every right to think about them all as a threat. As people she had to fight with and kill. As monsters that wanted her to take the life from her and from Peeta. But I couldn't think of them differently than just kids who had been forced to fight and lose their lives for the entertainment of a bunch of stupid people. Yes, some of them had been trained their whole lives for Hunger Games. They became true killing machines, like Cato and Clove. But did they have any choice in it? They all lived in a cruel world, they had to adapt to it to survive. Everyone just wanted to survive in the way they thought was best. Cato and Clove were killing machines, but they still had been just kids. Kids who had lost their childhood for the entertainment for the others. All these kids should been loved, cared for and protected by their government. But all their government had done was send them to their death.\\n\\n\\nI'm immediately diving into book two (try to stop me, hah!). I'm so excited to read it again. Finnick will finally show up! ;)\\n\\n\\n\\nP.S. My original review was longer and looked quite different.

      "      \"review\": \"This is yet another novel which would not have come to my attention but for Goodreads and I would not have chosen to read it had it not been for the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the book of my Goodreads friends. I'm so glad that I did.\\n\\nFor me, the most compelling aspect of the novel is what it says about our society. From the idea that rich and powerful people live on what is produced by poor people far away, to the concept of people being entertained by a reality television program the objective of which is survival at the expense of other contestants, to the depiction of a great “sporting” contest in which the success or failure of the contestants depends on their ability to attract wealthy sponsors, to the use of children killing other children as a weapon of control, these are all things that happen in the real world, right now. Certainly, the images are exaggerated*, but this only brings the reality of our world into sharper relief.\\n\\nI was engaged with the narrative from the very beginning. Although initially disappointed with Carolyn McCormick’s narration – I don’t think she does a great job with a number of the characters - I left my irritation with the narrator behind and fully entered the world of the novel. The details of the world are clever. For example, the depiction of the relationship between the Capitol and the Districts as akin to the relationship between ancient Rome and its empire is simply but effectively achieved by calling children who are sent to the Capitol to fight to the death in the Hunger Games “tributes” and by giving the Capitol’s inhabitants Latin names.\\n\\nCollins has also done well with the development of her characters. The novel is narrated by the sixteen-year-old heroine, Katniss Everdeen to whom Collins gives a very believable voice. Katniss is prickly, sullen and quite clueless about her own emotions, but she is smart, loyal and resourceful. It is interesting to watch her grow from resigned acceptance of the system in which she lives in general and of the Hunger Games in particular, to clarity about what those things represent, culminating in her light bulb moment,\\n. Other characters are also well realised. This is particularly true of Haymitch, the alcoholic mentor and former Hunger Games champion, who shows the classic signs of a veteran with combat stress reaction.\\n\\nSuccessfully pulling off a first person, present tense narrative is no easy feat, given that the point of view has to remain solely that of the narrator. Collins achieves this without faltering. While Katniss speculates about what she can’t see and doesn’t know, the perspective remains hers. Even within the limitations imposed by this narrative style, Collins is able to let the reader know more than her heroine is aware of.\\n\\nAs is to be expected from the subject matter, the novel contains graphic descriptions of violence. However, there is nothing about this which either encourages or glorifies violence - quite the contrary. The horrific situation in which the participants in the Hunger Games find themselves speaks for itself. Making choices in situations of adversity, friendship, loyalty and above all, what it means to be human are what the novel is really about.\\n\\nOverall, I found this audiobook riveting to listen to. The only reason I’m glad not to have read the book when it was first published is that I can go on to the second volume of the trilogy without delay.\\n\\n*There is no exaggeration in relation to the issue of children killing children. The plight of child soldiers has had a lot of exposure in social media in recent times. A friend of mine who works for the United Nations was posted in Uganda a few years ago, where his task was to re-unite child soldiers from the Lord’s Resistance Army with their families and communities. The sheer horror of what those children experienced trumps any fictional account of violence committed by and against children.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"See this review and more at my blog, The Scribe Owl!\\n\\n1. The Hunger Games: ★★★★☆\\n2. Catching Fire: ★★★★½\\n3. Mockingjay: ★★½☆☆\\n\\n4/5 stars\\n\\nThese books hold so much magic for so many people, but for some reason, they don't hit me in the same way. They're just semi-good 2000s YA. I know they were inventive for the time, but at this point, the YA genre has evolved so much that it has much more creative spins on the same kind of story. Part of that was probably that I just didn't read it at the right time, but it doesn't mean that much to me. I'm not saying this is a bad book at all, it just isn't that kind of perfection to me that everyone else seems to claim.\\n\\nEveryone knows the concept of this book, even if you haven't read it. One boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen are forced to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen knows she doesn't have much of a chance when she takes her sister's place. But if she wants to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.\\n\\nThe best part of the book is obviously the games. The intrigue they bring still hold up today and make it an interesting book! They're bloody, violent, and kind of awesome (but only to read about because I wouldn't last a second if I was in one). They're super creative, especially considering how little had been done in the genre before it. Actually, The Hunger Games was one of, if not the very, first YA dystopian book to ever come out! They were a little before my time, so coming and reading them now is like a little piece of YA history.\\n\\nThe characters were good for the most part. I love Peeta and Haymitch, but Cinna is the absolute best character! What surprised me on this read is that he was described as a young man. I never pictured him as old, but a man makes it sound like he's in his early thirties. I always pictured him as like a dad to Katniss, because he's taken on such a paternal role.\\n\\nKatniss is an interesting character. There are some aspects of her that I just love, and others not so much. For instance, I love her determination, but she's so blind sometimes! Peeta was sending out pretty clear signals and Haymitch literally her, but she still didn't get the memo.\\n\\nWhat I think everyone can agree no matter how much you love this book is that the writing is subpar at best. Suzanne Collins has an unfortunate problem with telling, not showing, everything that is happening. With such a bloody book there should be plenty of room for rumination and imagery, but everything was told to us exactly as it is, which was boring. Also, why was there so much focus on describing the food? I guess it is called the Games.\\n\\nThis isn't a bad book by any stretch of the imagination, but I just don't love it as much as most others do. If you love this book, I'm so happy for you, but it's just not my cup of tea. That said, I do own all three books, so I definitely can't warn you against buying them!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"4.5 stars ~\\n\\nThis, my friends, has been a long time coming.\\n\\nI didn't think I would like it so much.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games is a masterfully spun tale of sacrificial love and deadly choices. I was quite honestly blown away by the beauty of it all. However, I can't say I'll enjoy the next two half as much, but I'll try. Their plots don't seem to be as exciting (and I hate love triangles with a passion).\\n\\nDescription ~ Absolutely marvellous. 😍😍 I cannot utter one word of complaint in this area. Suzanne Collins swept me off me feet into a world of intrigue and excitement. She challenged my very idea of what solid details look like. Yet I feel her author voice is quite alluring in itself.\\n\\nSetting ~ Perfectly understandable. It didn't take much to show the landscapes . . . and with her sly comparisons I got the picture I needed without her droning on and on. ^.^ The arena captured the fear and the determination of Katniss without much effort. It was perfection.\\n\\nPlot ~ The pacing dragged in the beginning. But I understand why ... however the first quarter of the book was really depressing to me (Idk why). No one likes to feel depressed. Once they arrived at the capital it picked up nicely, along with my enjoyment. This is dystopian fiction (for those who were wondering 😂😂😂) and I have never been known to enjoy one half as much. Congratulations, Suzanne Collins . . . you have impressed me.\\n\\nRomance ~ Love triangles have never been my favorite trope. In fact they have always been the worst part of any story for me. This one is no different. I'd like to see what happens in the end, but there's no promises I'll be satisfied either way. >.< There was a little too much kissing IMO ....\\n\\nContent ~ Extreme Violence. Lots of kissing and touching although it never goes into much detail nor does it \\\"suggest anything ever happens\\\" between any of the characters. If you can't stomach heavy gore scenes (like me) I wouldn't recommend. (*laughs dryly* I went light-headed multiple times. I'm only glad Katniss didn't handle gore well too. 😅😂).\\n\\nCharacters ~ They all stayed true to themselves and made the story come alive with the differing personalities and weird quirks. I loved watching them develop into stronger people. Though--trust me--I didn't connect to any beyond Katniss cuz their all gonna die. O.o\\n\\nOverall ~ I thoroughly enjoyed the whole adventure and part of the message it portrayed. I even had to share the story with my siblings so they could enjoy it as well. ^.^ I'm crossing my fingers that the next two books aren't depressing. *whispers* and now I really wanna see the movies. . . .\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"This was a re-read of The Hunger Games. It has been many years since I had originally read these books. I have seen the movie as well. I do enjoy the book series more than the movies, although I thought the first movie was well done. There are some changes to the story, but for the most part it follows well.\\n\\nI believe this is my favorite book out of the trilogy. I really did enjoy this one. I like Katniss and I think she is strong for growing up hasn't been easy at all for her. She comes across cold, but I think she has plenty of reason for it. I love her relationship with Gale. They are a team and they just fit. With Peeta, it is hard to feel that relationship. You know that she cares about him, because he comes from her District. I don't deny that there are feelings there, but they feel forced. Where as Peeta really does love her and always has.\\n\\nOther characters that I love... I love Cinna and I loved him more in the books than I did in the movie. He is quite, but seems to really care. I love Haymitch too although I shouldn't. Haymitch is such a drunken jerk, but he is endearing. I adored little Rue and I think the way that Katniss is with Rue really makes her shine. that is when I really love Katniss more than any other time. I love her defiance by taking her time to give little Rue a little tribute.\\n\\nThe world is so different and wrong. I feel for all the districts. I hate that they are so separated and poor. The Capital is cruel to all of the people. They keep them suffering while they live lavishly. This is your first glimpse of President Snow too and I hated him from that first moment. He is one of those characters that I really despise.\\n\\nI think this is a fabulous first book and I'm glad I've re-read it. I have thoroughly enjoyed it.\"\n",

Did it leave me speechless at the end? No, but it left we wanting more. Dystopian stories are odd in a sense. Like the capitol is so weird if I'm being honest, but it's interesting. How is watching others kill each other entertaining?\\n\\n\\nI'm so annoyed with myself that I didn't read this when I was younger, I honestly would've enjoyed it. It was pretty good! Katniss was such a strong character, she reminded me a lot of Jude Duarte from The Cruel Prince. I usually am a big fan of those types of characters, they have faults which adds depth to them for sure, makes them relatable. And Peeta, omg Peeta I love him so much💗 He seems like such a sweet guy as I already knew from the movie. I liked how Peeta didn't want the games to change him. Honestly I prefer the book over the movie as I usually always do.\\n\\nThe only gripe I have about this book is sometimes it needed a bit more detail, that's why I rated it a 4.5. But other than that it was great. Overall I liked all the characters, the history was well developed too. I'm so excited to read the rest of the series!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"This review will probably not be popular, but it's good to talk about these issues. It is taken from a longer article written for Mercatornet http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/v...\\n\\nWar, persecution, abuse, suffering -- these are common themes in literature and I am not overly disturbed by them, at least in principle. Dark themes are a part of life, and even if they are difficult to face they can be invaluable for testing character, proving virtue, and drawing out what is most beautiful in human nature, as well as the worst. It all depends how they are dealt with.\\n\\nIn a dystopian vision of the near future, Hunger Games is a terrifying reality TV show where twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to compete to the death. The Capitol has imposed the games on the children of the twelve districts under its control to remind them that rebellion is futile. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her sister’s place, and though she sees it as a death sentence, she is determined to survive for the sake of her family.\\n\\nAuthor Suzanne Collins conceived the idea for Hunger Games while channel surfing between reality TV shows and news coverage of an actual war zone. It is not a particularly uplifting theme, yet Collins has many readers convinced that the book’s ethics are clear: it is a critique of the violent injustice it describes. I am not convinced.\\n\\n\\nIn the games, survival is the ultimate good and death the greatest evil; our heroine never questions this. She and the other characters do to survive, and for games contestants this means killing. Katniss is the good girl so she is subtle at first, dropping an insect nest on someone’s head so they swell up and die \\\"naturally\\\", or destroying another group’s food so they will starve. Her district companion Peeta confesses that “to murder innocent people costs everything you are”, yet indirectly and later directly, both he and Katniss still do it.\\n\\nThe experience is like reading a first hand account of a Nazi soldier doing horrible things to others in order to stay alive. The fact is, sometimes survival is not the most important thing and it is necessary to be prepared to die rather than kill someone else.\\n\\nIn Collins’ books, survival only loses its appeal when suffering makes death more appealing than life, justifying the suicide and mercy killing which are rife in the series. Towards the end the rebels—including Katniss—carry a suicide bomb in case they or their friends are caught. Failure to kill a captured friend is seen as a failure of friendship, and Katniss’ reluctance to use it is a sign of her weakness. Darkness–1; Characters–0.\\n\\n\\nNext there is brutal desensitisation so the characters won’t get so hurt (it is not acknowledged that this too is a form of harm), and romance used as a tool of survival.\\n\\nThe games are televised and sponsors must be sought to provide the food and medicine contestants will need to survive. Body appearance is therefore important: each contestant has a stylist who must first assess them without clothes (Katniss ‘bravely’ resists the urge to cover herself), and then a full body wax makes them camera-ready. This is probably normal for reality TV, but don’t tell me it’s brave.\\n\\nAt first, the other contestants mock Katniss with explicit offers and gestures because she is so \\\"pure\\\". But soon she \\\"toughens up\\\" and is able to laugh rather than blush at their provocative displays, and shows less of a concern to protect herself. As Katniss is \\\"built up\\\" (broken down), Collins seems to enjoy describing the loss of innocence; it’s quite nauseating.\\n\\nFrom the start, a fake relationship between Katniss and Peeta is played up to win sponsorship. \\\"One kiss equals one pot of broth\\\", so Katniss maintains a star-crossed lovers’ routine with long, lingering kisses and imaginary tears, and later the pretence that they are married and that she is pregnant.\\n\\nPeeta himself falls for it, but Katniss is just confused about what she feels. This doesn’t stop her from kissing, hugging and \\\"comfort' bed sharing with Peeta, nor prevent her kissing her old friend Gale \\\"to make up for all the kisses I’ve withheld, because it doesn’t matter anymore, and because I’m so desperately lonely I can’t stand it.\\\" This petty, selfish, mockery of love is all that is served up in Hunger Games.\\n\\nNot only did Katniss embrace her progressive desensitisation and confusedly false romance, but the book makes her a hero for it. Darkness–2; Characters–0.\\n\\n\\nNow to ethics per se. Actions are deemed right or wrong based on how the characters feel about them. For Katniss the pattern is repeated over and over: a catastrophic situation is followed by her passionate but often unethical reaction, then a soul-searching analysis of her feelings to deal with her guilt, followed by defiant justification that she had no choice, or, if she had a choice, that she was confused, which is the fault of those who created the catastrophe. Thus she becomes the victim-hero: none of the evil—including that which she did herself—is her fault: they made her do it.\\n\\nIs there not a little duplicity in someone who curses the horrible culture that sacrifices its children to settle its differences, when she herself has played along with it the whole time? Darkness–3; Characters–0.\\n\\n\\nSome may claim that Katniss did rebel. First, her fake romance: What is rebellious or heroic about this self-serving tactic? Second, Katniss' and Peeta’s threat of double suicide to demand that they both be allowed to live: after killing so many others her effort to spare a friend rings hollow. Third, her placing of flowers on her dead friend’s body: but then she goes on to continue the games, fighting and killing…\\n\\nWhat about the grand finale where Katniss joins the rebels to bring down the Capitol? Running on hatred, bitterness and revenge, the rebels use bombs and guns to kill hundreds of innocent citizens who get in the way. Katniss may not like the large-scale killing, but she has no problem shooting a startled citizen who blocks her path. Still, we are reassured, it’s not her fault. Darkness–4; Characters–0.\\n\\n\\nReinforcing all the above is the seductive sensationalism of the storytelling. It is like watching a graphic news story that turns horrific events into entertainment, using excessive detail and twisting the narrative to wrench every possible emotion from the viewer, constantly driven to bigger and better shocks for impact. The screaming, the blood, the broken bodies, the instruments of torture and the damage they do -- when all this is no longer enough the emotional impact of the slow and graphic death of some poor, innocent character we’ve come to like is thrown in. I don’t know how on earth the movie will rate PG.\\n\\nHow can this series be a critique of using injury and death for entertainment when it does the same itself?! Thanks to the gratuitous graphic detail not only the characters, but the readers too, are damaged. Darkness–5; Characters (and readers)–0.\\n\\nSo, what do we do now?\\n\\nReaders should question the lack of freedom and responsibility of these characters. Could they have chosen to act differently? Are they responsible for choosing to act badly? Would we be right to do the same in their situation? Are they heroes for acting as they did? If there is still confusion, ask the same questions about Nazi soldiers.\\n\\nAlso think about the effect of turning horrible things into entertainment. Parents may find some helpful analysis of the effect of desensitisation on our ability to love in Wendy Shalit’s shocking book (1998).\\n\\nIt will also help to look at alternative novels. (2010) by Caragh M. O’Brien is a recent favourite of mine. Though it’s also dystopian and deals with dark themes in a cruel future world, the beauty of characters’ actions transforms the story completely.\\n\\nThe heroine, Gaia, is an ordinary person who must learn from failures and struggle to face her fears. Flash-backs to her childhood show that her parents’ depth and wisdom nourished her character so that she was ready to face difficulties with courage and selflessness. At one point her mother has doubts about something she did in obedience to the government. Gaia would excuse her for not having had a choice but her father corrects her: “You always have a choice, Gaia, you can always say no”. The story shows that the consequences of such a choice are not always pleasant, but sacrifice for what is right is a triumph of good over evil, which is far more heroic than doing evil for fear of getting hurt.\\n\\nGaia’s own actions are true acts of rebellion: she risks her life by refusing to save herself before trying to save her parents; she saves a baby from dying along with its condemned mother; she rescues her mother and the child she is carrying... And when she is called to leave one victim for someone who needs her more, she is not governed by feelings but by trying to do what is right.\\n\\nThe romance is realistic but perfect: the characters’ love for each other grows for all the right reasons. They learn so much about each other and their flawed but earnest characters are the antithesis of Edward/Bella sentimentally and Katniss/Peeta falseness. What’s more, they demonstrate very real sacrifice; there is no better sign of love.\\n\\nSomehow in the midst of evil’s triumph, sacrifice for what is good produces a hope that is even stronger than the evil that weighs upon it. Thus the characters are victorious, even when the darkness seems to have the upper hand.\\n\\nThe style may not be as slick and addictive as in Hunger Games, and perhaps a lazy reader’s initial reaction may be that it’s not as good, but the characters positively shine by comparison. It’s worth thinking about the after-effect of books once the action fades and characters and story settle in your soul. That’s the part that stays with you.\\n\\nAnother alternative is (2006) by Markus Zusak. In the author describes the beauty of human goodness which can be discovered in the midst of great evil.\\n\\nThere are so many more great novels which explore dark or difficult themes but clearly show protagonists taking responsibility for their actions. Trash by Andy Mulligan (2010), The Hiding Place by Corrie Ten Boom (1971), The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas by John Boyne (2006), The Scarlet Pimpernel by Emmuska Orczy (1903), A Rose for the ANZAC Boys by Jackie French (2008), Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet by Jamie Ford (2009), The Help by Kathryn Stockett (2009, mature readers), Anne Frank: the Diary of a Young Girl (1947), Sophie Scholl and the White Rose by Annette Dumbach (1999, mature readers), Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery by Eric Metaxas (2007), Left to Tell by Immaculee Ilibagiza (2006, mature readers), St Maria Goretti: in Garments all Red by Godfrey Poage (1998), Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl (1946), Life Without Limits by Nick Vujicic (2010).\\n\\nRead and compare, and decide who the real heroes are.\"\n",

Said government divided its subjects into two classes, citizens from the privileged Capital, where people enjoyed wealth and power. The 12 Districts, where most citizens were forced into hard labors and starvation. Since the 12 Districts, along with the destroyed 13th District had once allied together and tired to rebel against the Capital, once the rebellion was suppressed, the Capital brought up The Hunger Games as a punishment for the failed Districts. A game that forced every district to select two teenagers and took them to an isolated Stadium. The selected teenagers were trained and forced to kill one another until there was only one survivor left, while the entire nation watched on.\\n\\nThe heroine Katniss was a fatherless girl from the 12th District, when her younger sister was selected for the latest Hunger Game, she replaced her sister and went to the Capital with a boy, Peeta, who was also selected. During the training and preparation for the Game, Katniss formed a friendship with Peeta, who she must eventually kill along with the other teenagers if she wanted to stay alive and go home to her loved ones;and Haymitch, trainer of both Katniss and Peeta, also a former Winner of the Game.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games, first book of The Hunger Games series, is cleverly plotted and well written, main characters like Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch are people you can very well related to. The ending is just brilliant. The action is quite good for a YA novel too.\\n\\nWhat I find lacking in The Hunger Games, probably is a bit of emotional depths and satire.\\n\\nI don't mean to say HG has entirely no emotional depth, for example Katniss' loyalty to her sister and mother, and the friendship/trust between her, Peeta and Haymitch looks pretty realistic. But once the killing started, you can't help feeling like you're watching an episode of a very twisted, deadly and violent Survivor reality TV game show.\\n\\nYou just know that Katniss isn't going to die, and somehow she'd find a way to trick or kill her opponents no matter how strong or well trained those opponents might be. BECAUSE WE KNOW SHE'S THE HEROINE AND SHE CAN'T DIE TILL THE VERY END. So frankly it's a bit hard to feel TOO worry about her.\\n\\nAs to those opponents mentioned above, they look more like opponents or pawns in a game show than a bunch of real people. We know hardly anything about them, probably saves for the little girl from the 11th District whom Katniss befriended and tried to save. Those other kids from the other Districts hardly had any personality or emotion that we might recognize, so it became difficult to feel anything for them when they died or when Katniss or Peeta was forced to kill them.\\n\\nWe never got to feel much of the moral dilemma and guilt Katniss and Peeta had to endure when they were forced to kill other people, because those who died under their hands had basically nothing to do with them (again saves for the little girl from the 11th District). All of the tributes only first saw one another a few weeks before the Game starts after all of them were certain they must kill all of the other people in order to survive. The rule of the Hunger Game makes it crystal clear that they're supposed to be enemies, not friends and buddies.\\n\\nThat's when I want to bring up Battle Royale. In my opinion, it's clear that BR had gone into a more hideous, uncomfortable area than HG by making the teenagers who were forced to kill one another classmates. It's a bunch of students who had known each other for at least a few years, who were familiar with one another, someone you see everyday going to school and using the same classroom. Some of them had even became friends and/or lovers. And you got those students battling one another till the last one standing? Then you got some real satire, cruelty, moral dilemma and vivid human drama going on, instead of just an episode of reality game show which the goal is to survive and to 'take care' of those opponents whom no one really cares about.\\n\\nMore disturbing still, in BR the movie, they had the students' very own teacher to be the executive of such unimaginable ordeal, the satire on adults' violence became really heart-felt since teachers are supposed to be protectors of their students.\\n\\nBack to HG, despite the well written story, the author offers us little space to explore the social, institutional violence and injustice that had allowed the Hunger Games to be operated for years. Maybe those issues are saved up for the latter books, I'm not sure.\\n\\nMy suggestion: It's a good book for teenagers or mature-enough kids; but for adults, it might be just a little too tamed. So do consider borrowing the book, you don't have to buy it.\\n\\n: here's an article to address the problems of Katniss being viewed as a strong female/role models for girls:\\n\\nReview for book 2:\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"\\\"They're already taking my future! They can't have the things that mattered to me in the past!\\\"\\n\\nKatniss Everdeen lives in a dystopic future where North America is now called Panem, the continent is divided into one Capitol, \\\"ruling district\\\", and twelve other subservient districts. Katniss and her family mostly ekes out a living in District 12, sometimes barely surviving. But when Katniss' beloved younger sister is called out for the Hunger Games, a yearly event where a boy and a girl from each district participate in a fight-to-the-death match, Katniss takes her sister's place. Will Katniss survive?\\n\\nI Liked:\\nIf I had to write the perfect book, it would probably contain these elements:\\n1. A strong-willed, independent girl\\n2. A journey or adventure or chase away from \\\"bad guys\\\"\\n3. A big \\\"life or death\\\" battle\\n4. A very laid-back romance with a realistic boy (Edward Cullen need not apply)\\nWell, whaddya know, this book exists and it's name is \\\"The Hunger Games\\\"!\\nKatniss Everdeen is definitely the \\\"strong-willed, independent girl\\\" I like to read about. She's smart, she's quick-thinking, she's resourceful, but she still has faults. Her communications skills are a bit lacking. She's brusque. She can't lie. She can't charm people. She doesn't have a D-cup with a Perfect Size 6.\\nProbably my favorite type of story is a journey or \\\"chase\\\" story. I love stories where a character has to run away from some bad guy, to survive by her wits and sheer dumb luck. What Katniss has to endure is precisely that: she must survive the Hunger Games, which means running away from the other 23 tributes that are trying to kill her, trying to hunt the tributes and kill them first, and to feed and provide water and protection for herself. Not to mention, the big \\\"life or death\\\" battle she must face and try to survive, which I won't detail any more for fear of divulging the hideous spoilers.\\nAnd then romance. Honestly, what girl doesn't want to see a little bit of romance in a book, particularly when it is well done and not the horrible Romantic Triangle or Romantic Stalker that seems so popular nowadays. For fear of giving away too much, I loved how we were never sure if Peeta really was in love with Katniss or if it was his big ploy to get sponsors. Plus, Peeta is definitely a charming romantic lead: if he is in love with Katniss, how sweet and romantic! How he looks out for her and puts her ahead of him! And yet, he doesn't exhibit crazy stalker behavior and can still argue and chide her like a real human being.\\nAnd while I didn't include this in my Top Factors for the Best Story ever, I do love stories that make a statement about today's culture. I couldn't help relating the Hunger Games to the billion of stupid reality TV shows on today. I also thought the way the districts were grouped were very similar to how distant our country has grown. And the vapid Capitol culture hardly felt like future dystopia to me at all...I swear to God, I see this sort of insipid behavior every day.\\n\\nI Didn't Like:\\nI found very little to dislike about this book. In fact, about the only thing that bugged me was the concept of the Hunger Games itself. I found it a little difficult to believe that this event could possibly keep the twelve districts from revolting. Wouldn't it do the exact opposite, make the districts more likely to revolt?\\n\\nOverall:\\nSaying this is an amazing book doesn't quite do this book justice. This book was so good, that I went out to buy the boxed set in hardcover when I already owned The Hunger Games in paperback. This book was so good, in effect, that I broke my OCD rule of buying in paperback, just so I could read Catching Fire and Mockingjay without waiting forever for those to come out in paperback.\\nSo, do yourself a favor, go out, buy the trilogy in boxed set and make sure you have a day or two to read them, because once you get started, there is no turning back.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Well, what a way to end the first book in a series, huh? Guess what? It's not the best way. No ma'am.\\n\\nThis is what I'll call the best dystopian YA book series I've came across, because for one, it doesn't include a used plot, and it's so unique that it makes me fall for the plot.\\n\\nThe book was an easy read, fast paced, a good writing style, just the perfect amount of anticipation required in a page-turner, and the writer certainly got me invested in all the emotional rabble that was going on there. The plot is not much, considering that it's just some sort of introduction into the real thing that I assume will happen in the next two books, but as I said, it was good enough, blimey, it was great, and kept me reading without really realizing that I was going through the book so fast.\\n\\nAs for the characters, who wouldn't root for Peeta? He's just the perfect amount of cuteness and goofiness and care and love and naivety; and he's just someone I picture as the guy .\\nOf course, this leads us back to District 12, to Gale. I, in all honesty, care about Gale's opinion in all of this, because it's extremely obvious that we had a love triangle coming to us ever since the story began.\\nNow, let's move to Katniss, stupid, heartless Katniss, the bad-ass girl that would stand up for herself without any required assistance, and would volunteer to take her sister's place in The Hunger Games, and would sing a twelve year old to death who happens to be one of her opponents.\\nKatniss, Katniss, Katniss... She can do all of that, can be all of that, cannot distinguish her feelings.\\nChapeau my darling Katniss.\"\n",

So good, they turned it into a movie!\\n\\nI personally read this book, and the remainder of the series, when they were originally published beginning back in 2008 and onwards, and when paper copies were being passed around my neighborhood.\\n\\nThe timing for the release somewhat overlapped with the end of the Harry Potter series (stellar!) and the Twilight series (overall pretty good). It’s this reviewer’s opinion that this book, while it suffers from a HP comparison, is definitely a more superior novel than Twilight, and I’m only mentioning these comparisons due to the fact that I read all three of these series books during the same time period - during original publication date span of late 1990’s to early 2000’s.\\n\\nThe Hunger Games is unique, compelling storytelling. You’ll definitely need to invest in the subsequent books in the series (books 1-3 make up the original trilogy story).\\n\\nI loved the books due to the fantastic world building, the unique young adult plot (it’s a fantastical dystopian story), and I just devoured each of these three books.\\n\\nI definitely enjoyed the books more than than movies, but the movies are also pretty good. I don’t even think I saw them in the theater, if that gives you an indication. I didn’t want to spoil the view of the characters I had in my head, and I think I may have only have seen the first movie, truth be told.\\n\\nDefinitely recommend you read this if you haven’t already. Most definitely recommend. Personally have never been tempted to reread it, as it’s an action based plot, that I now know the ending to, but newcomers to this series will surely enjoy.\\n\\nFour solid gold stars.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"The Hunger Games is written by Suzanne Collins and is a fictional book about fighting for life. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark grew up in the same district and went to the same school but couldn't be more strangers than they are now. Katniss is a 16 year old girl who lost her father at his work and has a never-there-for-her type of mother for herself and her sister,Prim and only has 1 friend,Gale. Peeta is a 16 year old boy who comes from a family with both of his parents and brothers and sisters, he's considered popular at his school and works at his family backery.\\nEvery year there is a reaping for a girl and a boy to fight for their life out of the 12 districts to be the only one living out of the 24 tributes selected. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are the tributes for district 12 and figured that they won't win without each other. Right before they sacrifice their own life so they don't have to live without each other they are rewarded the victors of the 74th Hunger Games.\\nThis book is well written out. When I was reading this book I could tell how the characters were feeling and could picture in my head what all was going on. This book is by far one of my favorite books that I have ever read.\\nDuring the games Katniss and Peeta come closer than they ever had and Peeta's true feelings for Katniss come out.They have to act like love birds so people from the Capitol will give them what they want. While Katniss is just pretending Peeta actually is falling for her. In the end they trick the people from the Capitol to thinking that they are the 'Star-crossed Lovers from District 12' and end up winning the games together instead of without each other.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"ORIGINAL REVIEW STAYS\\n\\nI'm gonna tell you a story: once upon a time, there was a girl who saw her parents who read this book series (they don't read much either) and knew exactly what it was because all her friends and others were reading it too. Not only that but the third and final book was coming out soon and so one morning she sees her dad in the living room reading book 2 and not far into it and by evening was surprised how he was a little passed the halfway point and thought, \\\"wow, this book must be that good!\\\" So, she asked what it was and he said it was a book called \\\"Catching Fire\\\" and kept reading. oh, it's one of those Hunger Games books. for MONTHS her mom kept telling her she'd love these books after that first time her mom recommended it, (after knowing the story) she calmly says \\\"No. I don't want to read it.\\\"\\n\\nso again, her mom and even her friends kept saying how much she'll love these books up to the point she would be at that one stage..... \\\"NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE\\\"\\n\\n\\nso one day she reads Percy Jackson and the Olympians and is HOOKED BAD and wants her mom to read the first book and little does this girl know that her mom wouldn't quite yet fulfill her end of the bargain until a year or so later that the girl was about to make.\\n\\n\\nBut her mom says: \\\"I'll read the first Percy Jackson if you read Hunger Games\\\"......yep walked right into that one. Problem for her: she REALLY REALLY wanted her mom to read Lightning Thief so she said, \\\"okay okay. I'll read Hunger Games. but doesn't mean I have to like it....\\\"\\n\\n\\nso she starts. she HATES chapter one and wants to quit it bad but her mom says, \\\"keep reading...\\\" again two pages later haha she hears her mom say after another complaint and goran, \\\"keep reading....\\\" and halfway through chapter 2or3, the pages flip and flip and flip and finally she is HOOKED and is definitely loving it.\\n\\n\\nonto book 2: she's MAJORLY HOOKED and book 3 is out so she doesn't have to wait at all but ends up getting spoiled in book 3 JUST BY GLANCING AT THE FREAKING FLAP ON THE HARDCOVER AND SMACKS IT SHUT AND FREAKS OUT! Great.....now it's embedded in her head....but lucky for her, she forgets all of that once she gets into book 2 and by the end FREAKS THE FREAK OUT!!\\n\\n\\nbook3: she misses two deaths at the end because she was \\\"bored\\\" in the first half of the book and it freaking dragged but once the main characters storm into the capitol is when she gets into it and misses the first death. second death she misread and had to go back and re-read it. the end? no no no NOOOOO! Just no. she did like it, but at the same time, the author could've done better. what happened to her *family? her friend from the beginning? And what was her new friend feeling years later? same with her? she wanted to know MORE and so book 3 wasn't her favorite.....at all. now? she LOVED the Mockingjay part 2 movie and as a movie buff in this rare case said, \\\"I don't care WHAT happens in the last part of Mockingjay, it just better be GOOOOD!!! AND....... IT DELIVERED!!!! Why couldn't that happen in book 3? seriously?\\n\\n\\noverall, this book series did end up being worth reading and she loved them (just not a huge fan of the final book.......something lacked with that one) and so this series MUST BE READ or at least this one and Catching Fire....just watch the Mockinjay movies and you're honestly good. haha but if you want a slow going final book, fine go for it. but she honestly didn't like it as much as the other two.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I read this in one sitting, and then a few days later read it again just for fun. Perhaps I have some latent bloodlust lurking somewhere in my psyche. Comparisons to Takami's Battle Royale (and the cult film adaptation by Fukasaku) are inevitable. The dystopian conceit -- a corrupt government punishing its citizens by sentencing children to fight each other to death in a public spectacle -- is almost exactly the same in Hunger Games. However, I guess it is hard to find a story that doesn't remind you of another story. Still...hmmm, Suzanne Collins, hmmm.\\n\\nHunger Games provides a nice update to the Battle Royale idea and is a perfect fit for teenagers who have grown up in the era of The Real World and The Hills. I caught the first episode of Real World Season 283 a few years back and was struck by how stale it had become. Producers must be hard pressed to find show applicants who haven't seen the first 200 seasons, so the kids who show up are so meta its ridiculous. On the first day, two girls started making out in the hot tub while wondering who among the guys they had just met must be the token gay character. (Show editors must be tearing their eyes out in hopes of any legitimate story arcs). Hey, look at me, I'm so outrageous!\\n\\nOf course, there is more at stake in the Hunger Games arena than in the Real World house of debauchery. What most interested me in this book was how heroine Katniss used her accumulated knowledge of the Hunger Games, having watched it every year growing up, to manipulate her status and progress in the games. She is aware at every moment that she is on camera and does her best to use this knowledge as a weapon -- one arguably more effective than her skill with a bow and arrow.\\n\\nKatniss's first person narrative gives the story its immediacy and sense of excitement; however, I actually feel that this sole perspective limited the complexity of the book. It would have been fascinating to have also had Haymitch's perspective or perhaps some behind-the-scenes gamemaker's interpretation of events.\\n\\nFinally, it cannot be denied that the book ended REALLY abruptly. I know it is the first of the series, and yes I am left wanting more, but this book felt really unbalanced. I am more impressed when books in a series both work together and also stand alone as complete works.\\n\\nStill, sign me up to read the next one! Get cracking, Suzanne!\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I didn't think I would enjoy this book. I am not normally a fan of YA (Harry Potter is not YA, you shut up!), but decided to read this one anyway. I expected a fluff read where I would roll my eyes often. I have to say that I am honestly surprised by how well-written this book was.\\nI don't see any point in going into the plot particulars; there are many reviews here that do that. But I would like to mention some of the things I loved about The Hunger Games.\\n1.) The first chapter is packed so full of important information, and it is artfully and wonderfully done. The reader gets all the necessary background on Panem, the Hunger Games, the Reaping, Katniss and her family, and her friendship with Gale.\\n2.) Although there were places where the book lagged a bit (days of Katniss sitting in trees during the games without any tribute deaths), those were few and far between. For the most part, this book hooked me early and kept me interested the entire time.\\n3.) The heroine isn't your typical heroine. She is surly and distrusting. She really isn't even very likable. But she makes no excuses for that and continues on.\\n4.) The \\\"love story\\\" isn't a love story. In fact, there is zero love on Katniss's part. Her goal is to get out of the games alive, preferably saving Peeta, too. Her motivation has nothing to do with romance, and that's nice for a change.\\n5.) The games brought out a hatred of The Capitol in Katniss, setting up the possibility of sequel books. Although this book would have worked just fine on its own as a single, it's usually a good idea to hook the reader into thinking of the continuation of a great story at a future time. The author did a fantastic job of this.\\nAll in all, I have to say that this book went way beyond my expectations, and I think I loved it. I am a fan of Katniss, and a fan of Peeta for completely different reasons. I will definitely read the other books in the series.\"\n",

Peeta Mellark enters a complicated relationship when he reveals his feelings for Katniss Everdeen. Peeta stays brave even if he knows Katniss prefers to love her childhood friend, Gale Hawthorne.\\n\\n\\\"Well, there is this one girl. I've had a crush on her ever since I can remember.

The answers are in Book 3.\\n\\n* * * * *\\n\\nDone reading The Hunger Games. At long last, I'm convinced I made the right decision to borrow this book from one of my physical therapists. It's worth the read! I'm even surprised the whole story is 90% similar to my all-time favorite show - Survivor.\\n\\nThe story revolves around a reality show in which two representatives from 12 districts of Panem are \\\"imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland (page 18).\\\" They are forced to outkill each other to become The Victor. Katniss Everdeen partners with Peeta Mellark. A love story blooms between the two as the camera rolls on, but Katniss feels something more for Gale Hawthorne - her closest friend while growing up. Will it be Gael for Katniss? Or, Peeta for Katniss? Well, one thing is for sure. Books 2 & 3 are next.\\n\\nInterestingly, this is the first fiction I've read that is narrated in first person perspective written in present tenses. Katniss narrates in past tenses only if she remembers her memories with Gale.\"\n",

Absolutely astounding stories with a sci-fi edge, maybe giving a glimpse of what could be. Terrific, endearing characters that you want to hold on to and read the next page, chapter and books to find out what happened. My wife told me there were things in the books that were not in the movies, but I found them very close. Certainly, I was able to know what Katniss was thinking in the book, but the great acting made the feelings known on film. I am not in any way saying just watch the movie and you're golden, because reading/listening to Collins' creation was worth it.\"\n",

There used to be a District 13, but seventy-five years ago, the 13 districts rebelled against the Capitol, and no. 13 was obliterated by the government. To serve as a warning and a deterrent to the people, every year since, the Capitol selects two children from each district – one boy, one girl, aged between 12-18 (known as tributes). The 24 competitors are forced to fight each other to the death in an elaborate, deadly, outdoor arena. This is known as the , and the event is televised as entertainment to the Capitol, and a reminder to the 12 districts that they are completely under their control, and that resistance is futile.\\n\\nWe open on the day of the in District 12, an annual ceremony where the names of the tributes are chosen to compete in the . The girls name is drawn, and to Katniss’ horror it’s her sister Prim.

A concept that has been copied numerous times following the success of this novel, and its two sequels.

All this world building meant I was quickly immersed in the story, and eager for more. repeats this process in the lead-up to the , so that by the time the start, my anxiety, excitement, and dread were through the roof!\\n\\nKatniss is a character I was quickly rooting for – the resourceful underdog, who puts others safety, happiness, and well-being ahead of her own. Since the novel is told entirely from her point-of-novel it felt like I was along for the ride, experiencing her every emotion as she did.\\n\\nA well-known trope in YA novels is the dreaded love triangle, which I am only a fan of when the third participant is clearly unlikeable or unsuitable, and that I am either made aware of this fact from the start, or they turn out to be nasty pretty quickly. This book unfortunately has two kind, likeable, hero-type, love interests, but since one is in the , and the other is back , there’s none of the annoying arguments, fights, and jealously, with them vying for Katniss’ attention all the time, and her torn over which one to choose.\\n\\nThis was my second time reading, and it is still deserves every one of its 5 stars, no contest. I had the pleasure of listening to , read by the superbly talented (actress: ). I delighted in every single word, and read the story with so much emotion, and her voice for each character was perfect. I knew she would be great, but she was even better. I will be holding off re-reading until the audio book featuring is released.\\n\\nI highly recommend to both adults and teens. It’s one that has really stood the test of time.\"\n",

The problem with hype like that is it sets unrealistic expectations for me. As I sat down to finally read the book, I hoped I could separate the hype from the reality and judge the book on its own merits.\\n\\nAnd it is a good book. It's not ground-breaking but it's still quite good and a novel twist on the classic short story, \\\"The Most Dangerous Game.\\\" In the near future, the former United States has been divided into 12 territories. Each year, tributes are selected from each territory to compete in the hunger games, a kind of brutal post-apocalyptic version of \\\"Survivor.\\\" The winner gets to live and wins fame, fortune and food for his or her district.\\n\\nOur heroine, Katsiss volunteers for the role when her younger sister is selected. She's whisked away to the Capitol to train and then to compete, along with the son of a baker from her district. The two create a splash in the Capitol as they are introduced to the nation and prepare for the games.\\n\\nAs an exercise in world-building, the first half of the novel is fascinating. Suzanne Collins gives us enough glimpses of the society she's created without hindering or taking away from the plot. The observations by the first-person narrator of Kat help the reader begin to slowly identify with her and offer up some criticism of the society as a whole.\\n\\nIt's really once the game itself begins that things take a step backward. There is some suspense to the game, the pursuit and some twists and turns along the way. But the book loses some of its early momentum when Kat is turned loose in the game. Hearing about her strategy is interesting at first but given that this is first-person narrated story there's not much question who will win the game. Thankfully Collins gives us a twist that covers this, defying reader expectations.\\n\\nAll of that said, I found myself wishing that this story was embraced more than a certain other series about shiny vampires. It's a better written story, better executed and shows more promise in one novel than that series has in four. It's not terribly new or ground-breaking but it's still a good story, well told.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Ok I am new to Good Reads and this is my first review. I had to do my first one for The Hunger Games because it really was the catalyst that started me reading again. I initially heard about the book when I saw the teaser trailer for the movie. If you don't remember the first set of teaser trailers then I'll remind you that it was pretty sparse. It had someone running through the forest ,fire and then finally a emblem of a bird on fire. It intrigued me but I did nothing about it. Then , while away on vacation, I came across the book for the first time. Funnily enough it didn't have the cover sleeve so I didn't know it was called The Hunger Games but it had the symbol of that bird and I remembered seeing it before. I laid out on the beach with this book in tow totally unaware of what I was about to get into. I mean I read mostly romance novels before this book and it had been a long time since I picked up anything new. I also had never read a dystopian type novel before so I really had no idea what the story was going to be about. I opened the book and began to read it until I could fall asleep in the sun but that did not happen. The way the character Katniss spoke in the 1st chapter and the way she described her life in Panem was incredible. When she described what the Hunger Games were exactly I was shocked, alarmed, furious, sad, intrigued and confused . I had never experienced so many emotions in one chapter of a book ever. I literally read the first chapter a second time just to make sure in understood the setting of this series. I then thought that there is no way that this book was made for youth between the ages of 9-12 . I never read anything so adult at those ages. It truly is a master piece. I was so wrapped up in this book that by the end of my vacation I came home and ordered the whole trilogy via Amazon just so I could finish it. It truly was a moving series and this book was the one that started my journey into other dystopian novels. If you have ever even thought about reading this book for even a minute then you have deprived yourself for far to long. Don't hesitate and just jump. This book , the whole series , is a ride you don't want to miss. Enjoy ;)\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Katniss Everdeen is about to be pitted against 23 other contestants, who will all battle to the death. This is Survivor meets Battle Royale. And I wish Nietzsche was alive to read this, because this is the kind of thing he talks about in On the Genealogy of Morals. But I'll save my philosophical rantings for another day.\\n\\nI love the idea of the Hunger Games, and I even think humans are just crazy enough to come up with this idea. My only problem with this book is that it didn't give enough of a detailed background for me to understand how their government system got put into place, which is always important in dystopian novels. Also, everything leading up to them being in the arena was so slow moving that I was hoping for one of Katniss's arrows to strike me in the head. But once they entered the arena, I couldn't put the book down.\\n\\nKatniss has easily become one of my favorite characters of all time, and Peeta is at the top of my shit list right now. You're in the middle of a kill or be killed competition and your only concern is whether or not some girl loves you back? Please stop. I think Katniss is exactly the kind of character I needed to read about. She may come off as cruel or harsh towards Peeta and some of the others, but is there a more caring person in this book? The way she tends to her family and even little Rue shows her true nature. Suzanne Collins did an excellent job with with her characterization, but I wish she didn't make Peeta come off as only caring about Katniss. I don't think it came off the way she wanted it to. If he was intended to be the pure hearted character like Samwise, she missed the mark.\\n\\nFor me, this operates great as a stand alone novel, and I'm not sure if I will venture into the other two just yet. I enjoyed the concept, and the emotions in it were very real. I wish the book was from a third person perspective, looking in on each contestant's time in the arena. It would have been longer I'm sure, but much cooler to see what went on when Katniss was unconscious. If you enjoy dystopian novels, you will enjoy this. It's realistic, and it's fun, in a sick and twisted way.\"\n",

Sometime in our distant future, our country is destroyed and 12 districts are born, to form a nation called Panem. The lower the district number you have seems to mean you are more fortunate. The higher districts live in extreme poverty. They have little food or possessions. A teenager, Katniss, has been doing the hunting for her mother and young sister for 4 years since her father’s death in a mine explosion. She’s lived a very harsh life in district 12\\n\\nPeople also live in fear of The Capitol. They can take you out at any time, and destroy your family or even your entire district. You can’t speak out against them or you will be punished.\\n\\nEvery year they have a ceremony that is called The Reaping. They put names off all teens from ages 12 – 18, from all the districts and pick two ‘Tributes’ from each district. These Tributes must go to the Capitol and fight to the death in what is called The Hunger Games. Only 24 Tributes go in, and one will survive. They are put into an outdoor environment that is created by the Gamemakers, and have to survive harsh conditions, attacks by other Tributes, attacks by Gamemakers. The games are televised 24/7 for Panem to watch.\\n\\nI don’t want to give much away, but Katniss takes the place of her younger sister as a Tribute for District 12.\\n\\nThe story is really fast paced, and it turns into a nail-biter at the end. I highly recommend this read! I cannot wait to pick up the second in the series.\"\n",

I bought all three (the hardcover edition in the slipcase) and am now through with the first, already having started with the next. The story is grim but also funny at times and definitely thrilling from page one right to the last line; the characters are not just black or white but very ambivalent (yes, even Cato at a point); you immediately find yourself in Panem watching the story unfold and at least I like the fact that you don't quite know whether you want Katniss to be with Gale or Peeta. ;-) Moreover, I really love the mindgame that starts in the reader's head about what people can be transformed into (or not) under the right (or wrong) circumstances.\\nSo thumbs up and 5 stars - now off to read the second book. :-D\\n\\nP.S.: Yes, I am curious on how the movie will turn out since the cast seems very well chosen as I discovered while reading.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Note:\\nThese reviews are old and need updating. I might do that soon.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the best book series i've read. Great job Suzanne Collins :D\\n\\nWhen you love and hate something in a book with ALL your heart you realize how great that book really is, because it has to be really special for you to get to feel all these mixed feelings and still say that it deserves not only 5 stars, but .. 7.. or 10.\\n\\nThe story is so complex, the characters are so well developed, the new world created by the author is absolutely fascinating, described so well and it seems so real it scares me, because is not the future I would like for human kind and it seems so possible. Suzanne Collins did an amazing job in writing this books which captivates you from the first pages in such manner that you can't let them go until you reach the very ending.\\n\\nThe story is constructed around a young girl, Katniss Everdeen, who all her life tried to protect her family at all costs and now she must do the last thing she can do to keep her little sister safe: die in the hunger games..\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, you must be prepared because this is such a powerful story. It takes you in a carousel of emotions and the adventure so great that it makes you dizzy from the speed and all the sudden changes, and the insecurity of not knowing who the enemy is or who you could trust.\\nThere is something that really made me fall in love with the \\\"hunger games\\\", the fact that the characters seem so REAL.. they are scared, they make mistakes, they don't know who to trust or not, they cry for the loved ones, they are so strong in some ways and so week in the others. Also then the dialog feels so real, the descriptions are amazing, everything is revealed step by step keeping you there waiting for more, needing to know more.. It's all a big puzzle and every time you you feel you have it all figured out you get this big surprise that changes it all.\\n\\nI don't know this for sure, but I guess the is my favorite, because it sets the stage for the other 2 books and it has a bit of everything: action, suspense, romance, drama, humor..\\nThe most important characters are presented here, and I don't know if it is just because you get to know them better though the story, but you really care for them and want them to be safe.\\nYou start by knowing that there is only one winner in this game, and Katniss is such a lovely girl so you want her to win.. and then you get to know also other people (like Rue and Peeta) and you just want them too so badly to find a way to survive, and you know that it's not possible and this really breaks your heart.\\n\\n.\\nI loved him in this book (the truth is that I loved him in the others too, but at the end of the first book I felt the most hopeful about him and Katniss, about their love). I would've probably loved to read something from his point of view, mostly I would've loved to read about the moments when he decided to stay with the Careers to keep Katniss safe (and this is funny because mostly he is the one saved by the other - even by Katniss), i wanted to know more about his reasons, how he managed it, how he really felt.. Because all we know about him is through the other characters and is not enough for me.\\nBut as litlle as I knew about him I couldn't make myself not loving him. From the moment I read the \\\"bread story\\\", from the moment he declared he loved Katniss, from the way he always tried to protect her, from the way he invited her to kiss him.. from the way he was so hurt by the fact that she didn't love him and only pretended to, but he was still there prepared to give his life for her.. Everything about him was so sweet in this messy world they were part of. Reading about him felt like a summer breeze in all the drama.\\n\\nAll in one: this is such a wonderful book. I would recommend it to the entire world, it touched my heart and I know that I will keep it in my mind for a long long time.\\n\\n\\n\\n____________________________________________\\n\\n| | | | |\\n____________________________________________\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"In one sense, Suzanne Collins crafts a fast-paced, whirlwind guilty pleasure; on the other, it is only a nice attempt at creating something memorable that misses the mark.\\n\\nIt really felt like Collins was trying to write something that would have the longevity and incredible following of Harry Potter series. The odd characters, their unique names like Cinna and Katniss and Prim (not to mention the muttations and the tracker jackers), just all scream Harry Potter to me. Even the villain’s name Cato looks a lot like Draco, don’t you think? Collins, though, just cannot make us become entranced with her world like J.K. Rowling does with hers. I am not especially intrigued, or even better really repulsed, by Panem, while I have imagined myself at Hogwarts—and I’m over 30 years old!\\n\\nWhile both books have to provide lots of backstory so we can understand the contexts of their world, only one gets it right. Rowling’s use of an outsider character is a brilliant device of narration; as Harry learns about Hogwarts and magic, so do we. The narration of Katniss, on the other hand, plods for me and at times seems unbelievable. Her observations and questions were often exaggerated, while Collins’ characterization seemed simplistic. Haymitch, for example, could have had much more depth than he did—his drinking could have been connected more to his damaged psyche having to live on after experiencing the horror that is the Hunger Games. In addition, those kids who actually survive the Games don’t seem especially traumatized. Yet, when Rowling's characters survive, they still feel like real kids facing a real adolescence along with trying to save the world. You believe it.\\n\\nI also think Rowling can write a better sentence than Collins. The descriptions of the extravagant food and fire-bearing clothing seemed like an attempt to just “color up” the world and make it memorable instead of providing real depth to the story; I was even bored at the long build up to the actual games. I was also bothered by the “new rule” added on page 244, and even more so by the concept of the sponsors, which seemed unfair and kind of lame. The love interest thread of the story was unnecessary, too, don’t you think? I mean, I thought Katniss was so badass throughout the whole story, and I hated that the author felt this strong 15 year old female character needed a love interest.\\n\\nIt’s a bit unfair that the book I had just finished before starting Hunger Games was The Book Thief, by Marcus Zusak. If you haven’t read this YA novel, you should. It is poetic and heartbreaking and scary and epic—I hope I can get a few young folks to read The Book Thief when I know many will read The Hunger Games instead. Where HG is light and action-packed, BT is painfully realistic and heavy. In one sense there is no comparison. (Zusak’s book tells the story of a German orphan who befriends a Jew who is hiding in her foster home, where she learns both the awesome and terrible power of words.) But yet, when I picked up Collins’ book and read the outer flap, it says about the author, “she continues to explore the effects of war and violence on those coming of age.” I was first intrigued—but Oh, the overstatement! The Hunger Games could have really said something the way Shirley Jackson’s “The Lottery” says something or like “The Most Dangerous Game” says something. The Hunger Games could have come close to The Book Thief, but it is no way in the same league. A missed opportunity, I think.\\n\\nThere are also obvious references our culture’s obsession to the reality show here. In a way, Panem’s ritual viewing of this despicable bloodbath surely is satire of our own low-brow viewing each week. The networks keep churning out the dreck, and we keep tuning in. While most reality shows out there are practically unwatchable, I find one of the first, Survivor, to have some real-life implications and some real parallels to Hunger Games. Sure, each season there are another 16 media whores trying to be the last one on the island and win a million dollars. But what we get to witness is a sometimes probing (but I’ll admit, ultimately shallow) look into human nature.\\n\\nHunger Games could have been as clever or as well-crafted as Harry Potter or as powerful or as chilling as The Book Thief. But it ends up being only a YA book version of Survivor—a (sometimes probing, but ultimately shallow) guilty pleasure of a show I enjoy watching when it comes on but I know deep down I’d rather be watching Mad Men. But kudos for Collins for knowing which is going to sell more books. Millions more people tune into Survivor than either of these much more thoughtful fare. Just as millions more, I’m sure, will read Hunger Games before they try The Book Thief.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"Everyone has books that they grew up with. For me, that was The Hunger Games; I was nine/ten years old when I first picked it up, and after that, that was it.\\n\\nI was just leaving children's literature at that stage. This was like nothing I'd ever read before. I read it, re-read it, begged my mum to buy the sequels and, when the movies came out, to see them. My best friend loved them too -- and even though most of our little primary-school class hadn't read the books, (It was pretty funny. It was basically tag rugby, but if you lost both of your tags, you \\\"died\\\". Everyone wanted to be District 12.)\\n\\nSince I was so young when I first loved them, rereading this book has been such a strange experience for me. There's the feeling of recognising something that partially shaped the way I viewed the world since I was a kid, and then there's the realisation of just how dark some of the themes in this book are.\\n\\n\\n- Collins' writing is impactful in a kind of way that it still clings to me, years later. I wouldn't be surprised if I remember this story for the rest of my life.\\n- The syntax is very short and clipped. It makes for suspenseful reading, and, while it's not the most gorgeous writing I've ever seen, it's used very well and fits in with Katniss' personality and the general tone of the book.\\n\\n- I remember that when I was younger, I had a pair of leather boots that I loved, just because they were like hers. I would think every time I looked at them.\\n- Also, now that my experience of romance is no longer giggling about a boy in the corner of the playground, I can appreciate the romantic side of this book much more -- which is great, because normally I hate overdone romance or instalove. Rereading this, though, i saw none of that.\\n- While we don't get too much information about what led up to the war/where the rest of the world is while dysto-US literally slaughters its own children, we're spared terrible info-dumps and given reasons for Katniss not understanding these things.\\n- but that's according to my modern-day standards. I don't know what the majority of books coming out were like when this was published. It follows the love-triangle, best-friend-vs-new-guy formula.\\n\\nI love how at the beginning, Katniss was just trying to survive the system -- but in the next books, she challenges, the system, and eventually brings it down.

      "      \"review\": \"I was up till five in the morning, reading about Katniss Everdeen and her participation in the Hunger Games. Katniss lives in District 12 of a country called Panem, which used to be North America a long time ago. It's a dystopian world, one burdened by oppression and poverty. The capital of Panem is a wealthy place called The Capitol, which rules the remaining twelve districts with an iron hand. Once there were 13 districts, but then there was an uprising and District Thirteen was completely destroyed, and the rebellion crushed. To remind the other districts of their helplessness and subservience, the Capitol holds the annual Hunger Games, a sort of reality show-cum- gladiator ring, where two tributes from each district battle it out to the death until the last man (or woman) standing is declared the victor.\\n\\nSuzanne Collins builds this dystopian society with flawless delicacy. The people are bitter and oppressed, but at the same time, the tone isn't completely dark and depressed. There is an air of resignation, even a sort of acceptance for a way of live that has been the norm for as long as most people remember.\\n\\nThe barbarity of the Hunger Games is balanced perfectly against the flightiness of people from the Capitol. There is the barest hint of a moral about oppression and suppression, but it is handled with the lightest of touches. And some of Collins' plot handling is beyond superb. She takes a sixteen year old girl and puts her in a situation where she has to kill twenty three other people in order to stay alive. She makes this girl humane, but not too soft-hearted. She's tough, and pragmatic but she has touches of tenderness. And so, despite the savagery of the entire situation, thanks to her skillful characterization, we fall in love with Katniss.\\n\\nIt's not that Katniss doesn't kill in the Hunger Games. It's how she kills, without ever coming off as violent or inhumane, that reveals the true depth of Collins' talent. She kills for vengeance, in self-defence, out of pity. But never, ever does she kill offensively, with the sole aim of advancing herself into the ranks of glory.\\n\\nAnd Peeta. What can I say about Peeta without coming off as a gooey, big-eyed teenager (which I most definitely AM NOT) with a massive crush? It's not the romantic angle of the Katniss-Peeta relationship that has me so moved. It's just the way he's drawn, an idealist with so much compassion, and a sly sense of humour. For the first time in a long time, I found myself considering a male romantic lead as a person in his own right, instead of merely an accessory of the heroine. I'm not sure how much of a role Gale will be playing in the future books, I scent a triangle ahead, but I hope Suzanne Collins handles that with as much panache as she's handled the rest of the book.\\n\\nThis books is definitely one of my top picks for the first millenial decade, and a treat you should not miss, if you haven't indulged already.\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"As dystopias go, Panem is vividly disturbing. We will observe it from the perspective of Katniss, a resourceful teenager effectively staving off her own starvation and that of her family in deprived and depressed District 12, a coal mining area very distant from the prosperous Capitol. These circumstances vaguely echo the disparity between London and the deprived and persecuted coal mining areas in the North of England. The scrabble to survive is barely leavened, and severely exacerbated by the annual enforced bloodbath and grotesque spectacle of the Hunger Games.\\n\\nApart from being a little emotionally clueless (I can relate…), Katniss is the sort of kickass female protagonist every YA novel richly deserves, and it’s impossible not to root for her no matter what terrible things she’s forced to do (actually I felt that Collins did a lot to cushion the blow on that front, so I guess I’d feel able to recommend this to older teens). The emotionally smart, love-struck, artistic Peeta is the perfect foil for her (and I enjoyed the against-type gender dynamics throughout).\\n\\nKatniss experiences luxury in the Capitol, but to Collins’ credit, this luxury is not edifying, and the people wallowing in it are either unredeemably awful, completely vacuous, drowning their wits in alcohol, or quietly in revolt. While gender was de-emphasised in the scrabbling-to-survive context of District 12, in the Capitol patriarchal beauty standards suddenly impose themselves and Katniss is “horrible” until she has been stripped of hair from the neck down. The only things cast in a positive light in the Capitol are the food and Katniss’ mysterious, brilliant designer, Cinna, who seems intriguing and potentially rebellious enough to suggest a reappearence in the sequels. The Gamemakers, on the other hand, are repulsively decadent, and completely objectify the “tributes”. Katniss’ depilation is a small aspect of the Gamemaker’s agenda of dehumanisation, which culminates in the arena. Katniss, Peeta, Rue, and even Thresh, by resisting in their limited capacities the Gamemakers’ attempt to turn them into murderous (literal) tributes, an atrocity exhibition, undermine the state’s power to terrorise the population into submission. This is a story about commodified violence as a weapon of domination in which flowers (and compassion) as well as arrows are weapons of resistance. And, in clever ways, love wins again and again and again…\"\n",

      "      \"review\": \"I watched the movie before reading the book I’m afraid, and I only did that because they were all added to Netflix and so I thought, “Why not?” It turns out that the movies are pretty good, and so I figured that I might as well check out the source material too. I don’t regret it.\\n\\nSure, there are elements to the story that I don’t like, but you get that with most things and I can’t really fault it for it. For example, it’s written in first person which is always a bugbear for me, and while I understand that it was to show readers an insight into Katniss’s mind, that doesn’t change the fact that I just don’t enjoy reading first person books.\\n\\nBut I got over it , and I soon found myself getting absorbed into the story despite the fact that I already knew what was going to happen. I also pictured each of the characters as the actors and actresses who played them, which worked well for some characters (Katniss and Haymitch, for example), but which didn’t work so well for others (Peeta, Gayle and the guy who hosts the games on TV). I also don’t remember seeing much of the big hitters like President Snow, but hey ho.\\n\\nMy main feeling about this book is that it’s the story line that carries it, and that any half-competent writer could have pulled off the book. The true testament of Collins’ ability isn’t the words that she wrote but the idea that she had, and her world-building is far better than the writing itself. But that really doesn’t matter because the story itself is so good and she did a great job of creating the government and the history of Panem.\\n\\nWeirdly, I feel as though something like this could actually happen, and it’s arguably more realistic now than it was when it was first written. I also wonder how much films like The Purge are inspired by the success of The Hunger Games, but then I suppose that The Hunger Games is inspired by a cross between Battle Royale and 1984.\\n\\nAll in all then, The Hunger Games passed me by the first time and I think I was reluctant to pick it up just because it was so hyped. I shouldn’t have let it put me off though, because it was a pretty good read and indisputably one of the most influential novels in YA literature. And sure, while it might not have been perfect, it still had a lot going on and I’m glad I got to it.\"\n",

The book wasn’t new but not yet the global success it became just a few months later.\\n\\nThe first time I read it, I loved it. There was Katniss, a kick-ass heroine with bouts of depression and a really terrible childhood. In so many ways Katniss was the perfect portray of a teenager, barely able to control her emotions and totally unable to understand them (or to recognize or empathize with the emotions of those around her), and nonetheless with a soul–crushing sense of responsibility and solidarity that shines through even in the hardest of situations.\\n\\nYes, this new world Collins had created was the sum of the fears of those of us who grew under the possibility of nuclear meltdown. A world where science and technology are very advance but where humanity has not become kinder, much on the contrary. But, despite the wonderfully solid and tactile world, I’m convinced that the success of this book comes from its characters, all of them imperfect, and because of that, relatable and real beyond the walls of the story.\\n\\nThis perception of the book has only been strengthened by my latest read of it. Reading it for a second time many years later, I do see places where things feel just a little loose, where the plot could be tighter or the characters less, for like of a better word, dramatic, but in general I still consider it one of the best young adult books around.\"\n",
