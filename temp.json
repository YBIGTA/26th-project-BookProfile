    "description": "I have a curse\nI have a gift\n\nI am a monster\nI'm more than human\n\nMy touch is lethal\nMy touch is power\n\n\nI will fight back\n\nJuliette hasn't touched anyone in exactly 264 days.\n\nThe last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No one knows why Juliette's touch is fatal. As long as she doesn't hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don't fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.\n\nThe Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war—and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she's exactly what they need right now.\n\nJuliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.",

            "review": "So, I actually didn't hate this as much as I thought I would. I enjoyed maybe thirty percent of it before it all went downhill, but... um... it really went downhill.\n\n\nI do not like to think about eyeballs. They just exist. I don't want to look at them. I hate this cover.\n\n\nBut that's irrelevant. The hideous covers are irrelevant. But... is that Adam's eye? Because the only thing I took from this is that Adam's eyes are blue blue blue cobalt blossoming bruise clear as the midnight sky blue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*aggressive coughing*\n\n\nMa'am, this is a Wendy's.\n\n\nI actually didn't mind the writing, as long as it wasn't about Adam's eyes. The biggest complaint I see is usually related to the purple prose and long-winded metaphors and awkward phrases, but I enjoyed it...? To a point. I thought most of the strange metaphors were accurate, and the somewhat unconventional style of writing really helped to portray Juliette's trauma, which was my favorite part of the book. Too bad it all disappeared when she ✨fell in love.✨ Because that's just how the world works.\n\n\nI did find some, uh, interesting quotes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd one of those hands is mine.\n\n\nIt's like... here, I'll write an example.\n\n\nHere's a normal sentence:\n\"I walk down the cold hall.\"\n\nNow make it as awkward as possible:\n\"I walk down the hall, the linoleum as cold as the corpses of the women and children they've killed, and my spine conducts enough electricity to power an entire city.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't love her, but I liked the portrayal of trauma even though it suddenly disappeared halfway through. She needs to stop thinking in strikethroughs, but I don't have any real complaints. She's frustratingly stubborn at times, but she's a YA protagonist, obviously she's going to be stupid.\n\nJuliette can torture/kill people with her touch. She was locked away at a young age and has lived in solitary confinement ever since. She's a little kooky. I don't really care.\n\n\n\n\nAre you serious? I have to choose between an obsessed problematic psycho serial killer love interest and a blander-than-bland cardboard cutout organic whole wheat waffle love interest??\n\nAdam is the organic whole wheat waffle. He's probably better for Juliette than the psycho serial killer, but apparently he's not the endgame LI.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize his character development, he went from a somewhat interesting mysterious weirdo and Juliette's third grade friend to... a very bland concerning weirdo and Juliette's third grade friend.\n\n\nThis is instalove disguised as we-were-friends-as-kiddos-and-now-I-love-you. Which is probably worse. Adam's entire backstory is that he was hit as a kid once (this was never mentioned again) and he's spent his entire life searching for Juliette. Because logic.\n\n\nI wouldn't have minded the abuse subplot if it were actually a subplot instead of something mentioned once and thrown away. Maybe if it, I don't know, actually affected him, I would call it deep and move on.\n\n\nI was okay with him until he and Juliette had a little dialogue sequence. He tried to give her a blanket (this was before he knew that she had magical killing powers) and she told him not to touch her, but he was being all rebellious and she said it again, and then she said this, to which he replied:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen someone tells you not to touch them, you back off. It's basic courtesy and respect. Don't assume it's about you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarner is the obsessed problematic psycho serial killer. In case you were wondering.\n\n\nSome of my friends have been telling me Juliwarner is a better ship than Julikent. I beg to differ. Adam may be an organic whole wheat waffle, but at least he's not an edgy guy with problems that could be solved by therapy but he's too tough for therapy so there's that. Ahem.\n\n\nHe's, uh, strangely obsessed with Juliette and continually tries to make advances on her even after she shows no interest in him. First of all, he needs to stop. Second of all, he's blond?? That was random, but since when are villains blond? I was picturing him with black hair until I searched up fanart to see what Juliette looked like and Warner was there with his blond hair. This is not okay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat worldbuilding? All I know is that there's something called The Reestablishment, which is a dystopian government that does bad stuff. What bad stuff? Who knows? And apparently the planet is all desolate now because the sky is gray. *looks outside* Oh no, the sky is gray. We must be living in a post-apocalyptic world because obviously clouds aren't a thing.\n\n\n\nI didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't like it.\n\n\n2 stars, get that cover away from me before I actually throw up"

            "review": "This is not a dystopia, it is a romance. This is not a novel, it is a collection of similes and metaphors, most of which do not make sense. I originally gave Shatter Me two stars because that's my sort of kneejerk reaction to books I don't like, but after thinking it over for a while, I can't recall positive about it that would justify a rating of more than one star.\n\nYou're probably assuming - correctly - that I went into this book with low expectations. This is completely true. Any so-called \"dystopia\" with a runway model on the front cover leaves me feeling sceptical. However, I was also prepared to allow myself to be surprised; a lot of my friends loved this and one of the biggest criticisms didn't actually bother me - purple prose. I think there's a fine line in writing between the pretty and the purplish and different readers will define it in their own way. For example, some reviewers thought that was just a mess of bloated purple prose, whereas I thought it was one of the most beautiful books I read last year. I have a high tolerance level for flowery writing. But...\n\n's numerous metaphors, similes, and endless descriptions just didn't make sense. What is this?:\n\n\n\nI just... This is one example floating around in there, but every second sentence is like this! That's not even mentioning the annoying strike-outs. Trust me, no really, , I thought people were being overly picky when they said the crossed out sentences were annoying. I actually thought it sounded interesting, unusual, especially because the whole thing is meant to be written in a notebook and I cross stuff out in mine all the time. People didn't exaggerate: it will most likely drive you crazy.\n\nHowever, there was one thing that for me was even more annoying than the descriptions, the similes, the strikes, and that was the stupid repetition thing: Again, if it had been used once, or sparingly even, then it wouldn't be so bad. I may have thought it was an interesting literary technique. But had way way way too much of everything (see what I did there?).\n\nAnd story? What story? *sigh* It's about time we just opened up an entirely new genre called \"Dystopian Romance\" or alternatively \"Romantic Dystopia\", though I don't wish to be pessimistic, I'm pretty sure half the new releases of 2012 will make it into that category. If there was a story then it drowned amidst the waves of overenthusiastic and flowery prose. This reminded me of in that the dystopia was there to make the romance interesting. One was certainly there to complement the other, but it was the wrong way around.\n\nAlso... kissing when you are fleeing for your lives?? I'm sure this is not the correct way of things, right? And yet it occurs in way too many young adult books. I'm like: \"run, run, run!\" but the characters are too busy swapping saliva. I must be old-fashioned in my thinking that staying alive is kinda important.\n\nThere are a lot of things that, had they been there, could have convinced me to up this to two stars. One star ratings make me feel sucky. But I'm sorry guys, I wasn't even entertained. The beginning was intriguing but there was so little plot beyond the romance that it quickly became tedious. I hated the prose, I felt nothing either way for the characters, this series ends here for me."

            "review": "Shat­ter Me, oth­er­wise known as: When Cre­ative Writ­ing Class Goes Wrong.\n\nI am all for exper­i­men­tal writ­ing, for stretch­ing your abil­i­ties and try­ing to find fresh ways to express ideas. Occa­sion­ally you end up with genius, but most of the time you result in pre­ten­tious, awk­ward prose that stick in the prover­bial craw of read­ers. This book is that writ­ing. There are plenty of exam­ples that I can give as evi­dence – but I shall stick with two rel­a­tively short ones:\n\n“His eyes scan the sil­hou­ette of my struc­ture and the slow motion makes my heart race. I catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around the frame of my body, as they cover me in some­thing that feels like the absence of courage.”\n\nThe absence of courage? Are you fuck­ing kid­ding me? We have a word for that. I believe that is almost the dic­tio­nary def­i­n­i­tion of the word cow­ard. I would explain what was wrong with the rest of the para­graph too but I want to keep this review to a 10,000 word the­sis at max.\n\n“I always won­der about raindrops.\n\nI won­der about how they’re always falling down, trip­ping over their own feet, break­ing their legs and for­get­ting their para­chutes as they tum­ble right out of the sky toward an uncer­tain end.”\n\n…right.\n\nI get, artis­ti­cally, that Mafi wanted to expose her read­ers to the mind of a girl whose san­ity is frag­ile and ques­tion­able, and that she’s try­ing to show this through the prose. I don’t think the effect works or is done par­tic­u­larly well. I think the work­ings of a trou­bled mind would result in more than bad analo­gies and a bunch of num­bers. Despite the fact that Juliette’s back­story and premise is inter­est­ing, we still end up with the same mun­dane, cookie-cutter hero­ine that can be seen in the vast major­ity of Young Adult lit­er­a­ture. The only thing insane about this novel is how pre­dictable and trite it is.\n\n\n\n\nWhen are pop­u­lar young adult authors going to pro­vide more to the char­ac­ter­i­za­tion of their main pro­tag­o­nists than: Irre­sistible, unique out­sider, in love with a guy?\n\nCan’t male pro­tag­o­nists have other qual­i­ties than: in love with main char­ac­ter, hot, tragic back­story to illicit exces­sive brooding?\n\nThe entire premise of Shat­ter Me promised some­thing dif­fer­ent and new. Yet we still end up with the same bland old fare.\n\nThe plot and pac­ing is awk­ward and cum­ber­some. Even when sit­u­a­tions are sup­posed to be tense, there is a sense of bore­dom and pre­dictabil­ity. I feel sad that this is yet again, another dis­ap­point­ing dystopian Young Adult novel that will join its sis­ters in the Mediocre Hall of I Can’t Be Stuffed.\n\nBut, if you do decide to visit, at least you get a free shirt!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne last thing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis review also appears on my blog, ."

I saw no potential of her growing.\n\nAdam is just there...\n\nWarner is just... almost there? I must admit that a few times, he had potential to be a good character. I thought he was the only character that brought something. He made me cringe. He made me angry, made me feel uncomfortable. He was getting there. At least then I felt like he had some sort of purpose in this story. Then he would say something so cheesy, so inconsistent with his character, and just downright stupid that I lost all hope in him.\n\nKenji was just fucking annoying.\n\n:\nBesides Juliette's constant whining and lameness and the cringeworthy romances, this story was just a sadder and lamer version of X-Men. It had too many X-Men vibes going on.\n\n:\nMafi, if you wanted to capture me with unique prose, thinking that if you repeated phrases fifty times every once in a while, had painful metaphors, and an unnecessary abundance of irritating striking texts, then\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe speaks like that in real life...?"

It also introduced me to the entire concept of purple prose. Prose can be beautiful. I’ve read plenty of books where the writing touches me deeply and the author is simply writing about the sunset, or a walk in the park, or the plight of the poor. If the author is able to actually tell a story without distracting the reader with the prose, I’m all for it.\n\nThat is not the case with “Shatter Me”. “Shatter Me” was over-done. It was tiring, distracting, and silly.\n\nAt some point, I was overwhelmed by the prose and eager for the story. And don’t get me started about the crossing out of passages in the book. It was something I did not enjoy.\n\nOverall-\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m curious to see where the author can go since it is clear that she can write. I think someone needed to edit her prose down to a more controllable level so that people could enjoy the story rather than cringe with every every every incident of prose."

It's skirted around in a mass of overwrought metaphors and complete bullshit.\n\n2) Said overwrought metaphors.\n\n3) The writing itself in general.\n\nDespite having a degree in English and Literature, I am usually pretty easygoing about typos and grammar, especially when it comes to self-published stuff.\n\nI mean just LOOK at the slang and vernacular I use in my reviews.\nI am NOT a hard ass about this stuff.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nWhen I am holding a professionally published, FINISHED copy of a mass produced book and it contains strikeouts, sentences starting in lowercase letters, and numbers one through ten incorrectly placed in number form, e.g., \"Juliette has 2 hands and 1 brain,\" my inner grammar maven's granny panties get twisted so far up her ass, it's impossible to focus.\n\nI mean, I GET that this was all a stylistic choice, etc. That the sporadic, all over the place, SHITTY sentence structure was supposed to reflect Juliette's instability, or whatever the fuck it was supposed to reflect, but I just can't get behind starting a sentence with \"4,\" my friends.\n\nAdd to that the insta-love between Juliette and Adam and the spindly world-building of a completely unclear and poorly wrought dystopian society and you have a wreck of a book that merely has a pretty cover.\n\nNow I am left with the crushing decision of whether or not I try book two (since I, like an idiot, already bought it) or if I just march the whole trilogy down to my favorite used book store and hope the fact that this series is about to have a new book published gets me top dollar.\n\nDecisions, decisions."

It hasn't changed. He can touch her, and she- the girl who has never been touched, the girl whose whole life she wanted to feel loved- she “fell in love” with him.\nNow, I'm pretty sure she's confused between love and this new feeling she loves, the feeling that someone touches her and that someone loves her.\nShe’s a poor girl after all, she never felt how a person cared about her, I can understand why she’s so sure she’s in love with Adam.\nAdam himself, well, let’s say I'm not so fond of him when he's with her. He’s insanely cringe in my opinion. The way he always wanted her, the way he looked for her everywhere. I’m sorry, It's too cliche, yuck.\nAnd Juliet? You may notice that she enjoys his touch more than him specifically. It's not love. Come on. Nope.\nBut I really like Adam in general, he’s very sweet. And of course Juliette loves Adam in general, but... I don’t think their love is true. Idk, let’s see how it’ll work out.\nThe plot itself was amazing. The idea is amazing. Kenji is amazing. Warner is amazing. Oh, Warner is SO AMAZING. He's a cute psychopath, it's the perfect combination.\n\nOoookaayyy, I'm ready for the second book."

It’s like someone is emptying their pockets over the earth and doesn’t seem to care where the contents fall, doesn’t seem to care that the raindrops burst when they hit the ground, that they shatter when they fall to the floor, that people curse the days the drops dare to tap on their doors.\nLet me translate what Mafi was trying to say; \"It was raining.\"\n\nof ; she tries too hard to be clever and poetic and the story gets muddied along the way.\n\nI apologize for not going more in depth with this review, but I read this book over three months ago now and all I remember is that I think my status updates should show this pretty clearly, but to make this easier to see, I've decided to write this somewhat brief review and sort through a few of my updates as well.\n\nA device Mafi chooses to use early on is striking out the words that \"crazy\" Juliette is \"really\" thinking. As the story goes on this device gets used less and less and so it feels more like Mafi just used it in the beginning for fun and to make her book look different from the rest of the young adult books out there, which, unfortunately, it is NOT, especially when you get to the romance. And that is what this story is: , and a disgustingly sappy one at that.\n\nI don't think you'll be able to believe these until you read them for yourself:\n\n\"I'd like to cry into his eyes.\"\n\n\"His body presses closer and I realize I'm paying attention to nothing but the dandelions blowing wishes in my lungs.\"\n\n\"I'm suddenly desperate to drink in every drop of his being, desperate to savor every moment I've never known before. I suddenly worry that there's an expiration date on this phenomenon.\nThe possibility of losing him\nThe possibility of losing him\nThe possibility of losing him is 100 years of solitude I don't want to imagine.\nRealization is a pendulum the size of the moon. It won't stop slamming into me.\"\n\n\"His heart is racing so fast I can't distinguish it from my own. It's 5,000 degrees in the air between us.\"\n\n\"I've run out of words. My pockets are full of letters I can't string together.\"\n\n\"I want to fall asleep to the sound of his heart beating in the atmosphere.\"\n\n\"His eyes are a midnight moment filled with memories, the only windows into my world.\"\n\n\"My heart fails for a moment.\nThere are 400 cotton balls caught in my windpipe.\"\n\n\"James and Adam glance back at me and I melt into pink Play-Doh.\"\n\n\"I'm up.\nSpinning.\nScanning.\nScared.\nThey found us is the only thing I can think of. My stomach is a flimsy crepe, my heart a raging woodpecker, my blood a river of anxiety.\"\n\n\"It's raining today. The sky is weeping for us.\"\n\n\"His lips are spelling secrets and my ears are spilling ink, staining my skin with his stories.\"\n\n\"The sun is revolving around the moon when he responds.\"\n\n\"I offer him a smile. Try to keep my organs from falling out. Hope the holes in my head aren't showing.\"\n\n\"My mouth is sitting on my kneecaps.\"\n\n\"My neck snaps up to meet his dark eyes, his smooth voice, silky and strong.\"\n\n\"My jaw is dangling from my shoelace.\"\n\n\"I'm blushing through my bones.\"\n\n\"Adam pulls back just a tiny bit. Kisses my bottom lip. Bites it for just a second. His skin is 100 degrees hotter than it was a moment ago. His lips are pressed against my neck and my hands are on a journey down his upper body and I'm wondering why there are so many freight trains in my heart, why his chest is a broken harmonica.\"\n\nAnd that, my friends, is that. Even if I didn't think the writing was trite and overwrought, later on it really starts to feel like she's borrowing heavily from the X-Men mythos (even though she claims she's never even seen the movies.) If you read the few quotes I've listed above and they're not your cup of tea, I'd say skip this one and try something else. Or maybe watch one of the X-Men movies instead; you'll get a much better portrayal of Rogue and a steamier love story. Mmm ... Wolverine."

This wasn't a bad book, but it wasn't great either.\n\nThe start was interesting, the middle was okayish and the end was pretty underwhelming. I was confused about the majority of the time as not only was the writing style strange, it was also bland. In order for the reader to understand, you gotta give them answers and I feel like I barely got any.\n\nis intriguing and impossibly naive. I hope I see some character growth in the next one. as an individual is sweet and I like him. Adam with Juliette? Ugh no. Things happened way too fast and the love equation did not make sense. was someone I genuinely liked as he was charming and his villain self was hot. I assume there's a lot of foreshadowing in what he says to Juliette but regardless there's more chemistry between them rather than with Adam. was too chaotic for me.\n\nOverall, it's like there were a lot of words for nothing to happen, and no answers to be given. Still, am not completely put off and I do have the box set so gotta continue 🤷‍♀️\n\n\n~•~•~\nIf I don't read it now, I never will. So.. *deep breath* LET'S DO THIS!!!"

THAT DOESN’T MEAN YOU CAN JUST WRITE WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT HOWEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.\n\nfirst, the strikethroughs. what is wrong with you? how did you come up with this? are you okay? are you blind??? because this is really bad.\n\nthen there’s the writing every number numerically and not spelled out. that’s just dumb and immature, because no one else does this. it sticks out like a sore thumb and aesthetic wise, my eyes don’t like to read it either.\n\nthen there’s the repetition. my brain my brain my brain was just about falling out out out. and of course there’s never any correct grammar because why start now.\n\nand the worst of it all… the metaphors.\nthis is the worst use of figurative language i’ve ever read or even heard of in my entire life. it deserves an “inappropriate use of figurative language” trigger warning.\n\nand of course i have receipts:\n\ntahereh: “im wearing dead cotton on my limbs and a blush of roses on my face.”\ncaitlin: the fuck??\n\ntahereh: “his gaze is fixed on me: calm, unflappable; 2 buckets of river water at midnight. i’d like to cry into his eyes.”\ncaitlin: seriously, WHAT? and that sounds SO unsanitary like ew? and i barely like eyedrops.\n\ntahereh: “my body is a carnivorous flower, a poisonous houseplant, a loaded gun with a million triggers and he’s more than ready to fire.”\ncaitlin: this is actual bullshit. doesn’t mean anything. tahereh’s just hot for the sound of her own prose. not even a high school english teacher could find meaning in this shit.\n\ntahereh: “‘you belong with me!’ ‘she belongs with me.’”\ncaitlin: you’re on the phone with your girlfriend, she’s upset. she’s going off about something that you said, cause she doesn’t get your humor like i do.\n\nokay that one was unrelated, i just needed a break before rereading these quotes makes me carve out my own eyeballs with a rusty fork.\n\ntahereh: “i fall off a ladder holding a paintbrush dipped in red.”\ncaitlin: no, this isn’t literal. i can’t even pretend to know what’s going on here.\n\ntahereh: “i offer him a smile. try to keep my organs from falling out. hope the holes in my head aren’t showing.”\ncaitlin: oh i’ll give her a real hole in her head. because no, this also isn’t real,\n\n———\n\nnow the characters.\n(i had to come back for round two to write this at a later date.)\n\njuliette—\nis insufferable.\ni can’t believe i have to spend all of these books stuck inside her head.\nbut more than just not really liking her, i hate what she stands for.\n\nthe 2000s/2010s peak of bad-good ya dystopian novels is near and dear to my heart, that shit raised me, but god i’ve forgotten how strongly i hate these female main characters.\n\nthese characters like juliette who are special but sad and some of the most horny people i’ve ever had the misfortune of meeting, but of course we’d never call it that because that’s improper or something, so instead the reader is bombarded with phrases like “heat” and “thunder” and “lightning” and other names of men’s cologne.\n\nthere is little that absolutely annoys the fuck out of me like the infantilized teenage girl mold: this girl who lives in complete isolation for years and, y’know, is 17, but just discovers her body in the presence of a man! and we get to hear all about it! fuck that shit.\n\nanyways, other than that, she is just boring. pretty dumb. nothing new.\n\nadam—\nis boring. so vanilla.\nkinda wish he’d died, not because he’s bad but he’s just so mid. juliette’s head over heels and like… for what?\n0/10, is a fucking pushover and doesn’t even have the personality to make up for that.\n\nnow, warner—\nor rather, aaron. i’m not calling him warner, that’s so uncomfortably formal and let’s be real, he’s just a nepo baby and a literal child with an overinflated ego and half of the DSM-5.\n\nfor all you girlies saying, “oh i loved warner since the first book, blah blah blah,” and everyone else joking like, “that makes you a red flag lol,” we’re not kidding. holy shit?! liking him in the first book, before the actual plot makes it so you can like him, isn’t a heads up on everyone else.\nthis is some weird phenomenon that’s started up in book communities, you see it with acotar and tfota too.\nthis is not a flex. you’re not supposed to like him right now? and i don’t see a reason to, he’s actually awful. a piece of shit. and also doesn’t even have a personality to make up for his shitty ass actions.\n\nanother thing, there was one line where he made her dress in a skimpy outfit and then stands there ogling her and she says something like, “i’m so uncomfortable, i want to sew the carpet to my skin.” bad writing aside, i felt that shit in my soul. being ogled, catcalled, and just generally objectified is one of the most disgusting feelings in the world. it makes you want to tear your skin off your body. we’re meant to like this guy? he means as much to me as that one creepy neighbor when i was 10 and i hope they both get hit by a car.\n\ncastle—\ndoes castle turn evil or bad? i feel like he does. it’s giving the-only-black-guy-in-twilight-is-evil vibes.\n\n———\n\nthe plot.\n\nis the plot in the room with us?\n\nbasically, you know how most books, even parts of series, have some kind of overarching plot to the book that then weaves into the series as a whole? because that’s good writing?\nwell, surprise surprise, not here.\ni feel like i’m watching an episode of a season of this larger story, so there’s no wrap up at the end, no specific climax in the story, and no cohesive storyline. it’s a mess.\ni literally turned the page and couldn’t believe it had finished, and not because i was involved or anything, but because there was no sign of it ending at all, it’s like tahereh just decided to cut it off at a random chapter and boom, end of book.\n\n\nanywho (this is my concluding statement, watch and learn?), as i’m sure you’ve figured, i did not have a fun time and i deeply regret spending money on this. oh, how i wanted to be one of the bookstagram tahereh mafi stans. maybe in another life."

            "review": "Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest\n\n\nIt's not easy being Queen of Literary Trash. Between YA and bodice-rippers, I read more \"bad\" books than most elitist snobs will see in their entire lifetime. But then, I consider myself a connoisseur of the so-called trashy arts. There are two kinds of \"bad\" books. There are the books that tell good stories and while they aren't highbrow literature, they are still fun to read and if you can let go of your snobbery long enough to enjoy them, will perform quite serviceably as quality entertainment. Then there are the books that are just bad, and have no redeeming value at all.\n\n\n\nI had friends warn me about SHATTER ME. It's apparently infamous for the \"creative\" metaphors that the author likes to use. It's also yet another attempt to cling to the coattails of THE HUNGER GAMES (although it's more like DIVERGENT than THE HUNGER GAMES, which if you know my thoughts on DIVERGENT, you will know is not a compliment, coming from me). The premise is pretty undeveloped. Juliette has been in captivity for just under a year when she accidentally killed a boy by touching him. Her touch, you see, is deadly. She's like Rogue, from X-men. One touch, and your life force is hers.\n\n\n\nIt's set on a dying Earth but why and how it's dying are incredibly vague. We've apparently allowed a fascist-tolerant (if not outright fascist) regime to gain power, which I say is not really giving the world a whole lot of credit, but on the other hand I'm a liberal living in the United States right now, so on the OTHER hand, maybe future Earth is totally stupid enough to do that. It seems to happen a lot in YA dystopians, to the point where the reader begins to wonder if all it takes to start a fascist regime is a kickstarter and a special license. What matters is that resources are thin and there is not a lot of food and there are parts of the world that are radioactive(?) and for some reason, some people (especially Juliette) have mutant-like powers for Reasons and this is the world we live in.\n\n\n\nBoth love interests are, conveniently, immune to Juliette's power. Because I guess it wouldn't be much of a romance if the book took the MC Hammer \"Can't Touch This\" approach to courtship. There is instalove up the wazoo in here, and even when Juliette finds out that Adam was put in her cell to spy on her under the guise of being a fellow prisoner, she forgives him stunningly quickly, and is constantly telling us how much she wants to touch him. She wants to touch the villain, Warner (I'm sorry but I can't take you seriously when I'm picturing the dancing frog mascot of the WB), too, although it's a traitorous body sort of desire to touch, the I-love-to-hate-how-I-hate-to-love-you type. Warner was the biggest potential sell of this series to me because I love villainous love interests but he's too creepy, even for me. Between the constant unwanted pet names and the really disturbing \"I could just take a bite out of you\"-type comments, this dude was about one villain notch away from singing a Tim Curry song\n\n\n\nThen there's the writing itself, which can be broken down into three categories: OMG, WTF, and LOL.\n\n\n\nOMG:\n\n\n\n(68).\n\n\n\n(163).\n\n\n\n(310).\n\n\n\nWTF:\n\n\n\n(6).\n\n\n\n(40).\n\n\n\n(172).\n\n\n\n(326).\n\n\n\nLOL:\n\n\n\n(151).\n\n\n\n(286).\n\n\n\nThe author also makes two other attempts at being creative, which are overuse of the strikethrough tool and overuse of numbers, written as numerals instead of being spelled out. Which, if you ask me, is 1 bad idea because not only does it look unprofessional as 0 other writers do this, but 2, comes across as overly gimmicky and makes you feel like you're reading cast-offs from a teenager's poetry journal as she tries - and fails - to channel Ellen Hopkins and/or Rupi Kaur.\n\n\n\nIf you like this book, good for you, I guess. I personally couldn't stand it. It felt incredibly derivative, and from the woe-is-me beginning to the yay-I've-got-a-hypersexualized-supersuit ending, there was just way too much I ended up side-eying in this book for me to enjoy it. I don't think I'll be reading the sequels, not even for the lols.\n\n\n\n1 star"

There were so many things I loved about this book and whilst it is true that many people complained about the writing style, I have to admit that I actually loved it.\n\n\n\nI think it was something new and extraordinary and I loved the way Juliette described her world. The repetitions, her thoughts, the things she thought and even the truths she vehemently refused to admit. It all gave me a very good picture of her character and her mind, the many things she must have gone through shaping her into a person that distrusts everyone and desperately tries not to feel anything. XD Of course she’s failing but this actually only made her even more likeable. *lol*\n\nSee where I’m getting at? Tahereh Mafi knows exactly what she’s doing and she really managed to drag me into her world. Yes, I confess! I’m officially hooked now and I’m soo going to read all of the other books! ;-P\nSo be prepared to read many reviews! *LOL*\n\nOkay, enough of the threats and right back to the characters! Oh, the characters! There’s so much to tell! XD\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the book you don’t even know her name. Everything you know is that she’s been imprisoned for ages and that she’s more than just a little insecure. Considering her ability this is no surprise though, the fact she can hurt and even kill people with just the touch of her fingertips making it kind of hard to be all too sociable. Juliette may not talk a lot but she sees everything and she’s more than just observant. She obviously also seems to have a knack for poetry and I really enjoyed the way she used her words.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat boy is hot as hell and Juliette’s new cell mate! Could a girl ask for more? Dark hair, blue eyes, awesome and muscular body! *drools* Okay, okay! I’m back on track! *lol* Yeah, as you can see Adam is just awesome boyfriend material and it’s no wonder that they kind of hit it off! He’s caring and gentle and he always tries to understand Juliette’s thoughts. I liked him from the beginning and I’m really curious to find out how things are going to proceed in the next books. =)\n\nSidenote: Is it just me or does he never tell Juliette that he loves her? O_o I thought this was kind of odd. Juliette told him she loved him but as far as I could read he never returned it…. Did I miss anything? xD\n\n\n\n\n\nOh my god! Warner! Gosh! Warner! Argh! Warner! *babbling mess* That boy, that boy gave me all the feels! Good and bad! Happy and angry! Disgusted and longing for more! *lol* I wanted him to touch Juliette and I wanted her to touch him! I just couldn’t decide if I wanted it because I wanted him to hurt or because I wanted them to make out! *LOL* What is it with me and the villains? Why do I love them so much!? XD First Maven and now Warner, I think I’m going to die! >_< Oh, well I think I’m supposed to say something about his character as well so here I go: He’s ruthless when he is with his soldiers but he is gentle whenever he is with Juliette. He seems to care about her a LOT and he even admitted that he loved her! But why does he hurt her so much? Warner is a big question mark and some sort of mystery I’m determined to solve. So yesh, I’m so going to read “Destroy Me” after I wrote this review! XD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI loved Kenji! That boy is so funny and I really enjoyed his sassy demeanour. He’s constantly hitting on Juliette and his character gives the book a hilarious edge. I want more of him and actually can’t wait to meet him again! =)\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if you haven’t already figured it out:\nYES I liked “Shatter Me” and I can easily recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a nice and short-lived page turner! =)\n\nEnjoy! ;-P"

The lack of world building is one of my main issues with this book (even though it seems like things will be explained in book 2... a full book with little world building is boring!).\nI didn't love the writing and the characters felt very one dimensional.\n\nKinda felt like another YA dystopian world with a love triangle and an incredibly pretty main character - even after spending over 6 months isolated, underfed... and the fact that she hasn't seen herself in the mirror in 3 years... Her beauty is mentioned in pretty awkward moments.\n\nIf it wasn't for the fact that people say the series becomes way better after book 1 I would stop but I'll give the second book a try!"

            "review": "dnf @ p. 127.\n\nYeah, well, you know how is this.\n\n15 y/o me would have loved this book, she would. You know, I'll create a new shelf specifically for old YA books of 2012 that back in then I'd have probably loved, or at least liked, to put in there this kind of disappointments, ok? I need name suggestions because my last braincell just died trying to finish this book.\n\nSo, we have Juliette, a girl who can kill or torture people with her touch. She killed someone before and for that, she was sent to an asylum. She has a new cell partner, Juliette hasn't touched anybody in 3 years, or talked with somebody in that time. And she thinks she knows her partner: a guy named Adam. And, oh, she does: he was her classmate in third grade, but he doesn't remember her.\n\nIn within a couple weeks, Juliette falls for Adam. She recognizes her blue eyes, and she describes them in several ways that made me realize that that kind of blue is now tattooed on my brain. Suddenly, some armed guys take Juliette and Adam out of the asylum and take them to a thing called The Reestablishment, that took everything from her, yada, yada, yada.\n\nAnd turns out that, oh wow!, Adam is a soldier and lied to her (in what? idk, y'all, because he didn't talk to her a lot in those two weeks), and betrayed her (betrayed you how? You two only met for a couple of weeks and you barely talked to him). Now, this new guy appears: Warner. He wants Juliette on his team for torture rebels and that shit :D\n\n\nThe writing was ok? I guess? I don't know, man. Some metaphors were cool, but others were exaggerated. The pacing was ok for a YA dystopian book, idk, the metaphors were taking away everything logical here. I mean, it wasn't bad to hate it, but I was getting confused sometimes. For me, a Spanish native speaker, the pacing, the writing and the level of English was cool and understandable.\n\nBut, the famous but, the thing with the numbers got me spending more braincells that I can usually afford. There's a reason why I'm a lit student and I quit math and numbers a long time ago. I also noted that there's a lot of and words repeated 3 times times times, which got me confused, and tired.\n\n\nUhm, this sucked. Juliette only described two places. The asylum (and barely, bc she only described her cell) and the famous Reestablishment, but even like that, it wasn't described at all. It was poor. The sky is grey, but, isn't like that when it's rainy?\n\nHere: a pic of grey sky that I took of the back of my house, lmao. Please, ignore the bad quality that GR added to it.\n\n\n\n\nI must admit that Juliette's trauma was well protrayed, it was ok and tolerable. But then.... she fell in love. Sometimes, I get upset and pissed off because she was annoying as hell. But, I don't blame her or the author: that book was written back in 2011 I guess, so, it was normal that female MC's in those books were annoying to the point that you wanted to throw them a shoe. Also, hun, you should have killed Warner when he asked you to touch him. Get rid of that asshole. EVEN IF I KNOW THAT THEY'RE ENDGAME, LMAO.\n\nAlso, Juliette says in a part: hOW, ON EARTH, ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT????\n\nAdam is so bland and boring. And oh, plot twist, he does remember Juliette. Oh, wow, you didn't see that coming? (As a hard Pietro Maximoff fan, that line hurts bad, please, don't touch me). And he wants to run away with her. He wasn't interesting at all. He was the only nice kid with Juliette, but they never talked, lmao.\n\nThe famous Aaron Warner. Well, what do you want me to say? He's a fucking dick. Those 4 words resume my feelings toward him. I hate whenever he calls Juliette just hit him with a rock. And the only smart braincell of Juliette finally says something logical.\n\n\n\nFinally, some guts.\n\nWarner is a psycho killer with daddy issues and feels like he's some sorta god or what I know, but he's just an annoying ass who should ✨fuck✨off✨. Juliette asks him why he's being nice to her... Honey, he's not. He just wants something from you: your power. Have a little bit of self love. He's also a stalker and a creepy guy.\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, Warner, ✨fuck✨you✨.\n\nJuliette saying that she wants to crush Warner's spine is a GREAT MOOD.\n\nPeople kept saying to me that I was going to love him on the novella about him, but if I dnf this book, I'd hardly read the next ones, or the novellas.\n\nMy big ass question for the Warner fans are: how can you love him? He's a dick 90% of the time and a psycho the other 10%. Does he get over his daddy issues and goes to therapy? Because if he does, that would be a very good first step.\n\nThe only nice quote that I liked it was this:\n\n\nLook, if you liked Shatter me book and series, it's fine. I'm actually glad that people enjoyed this while I was trying to figure it out if the problem is not me or what. If you also loved Warner, it's ok, I get it. Perhaps he changes and become something good. For those who liked, loved and enjoyed Shatter me: I admire you because it's something that seems pretty far away from me, impossible is more accurate.\n\nI should stop reading hyped books of 2012 because they're not for me anymore. Once more, back in that year, I'd loved them, but now, I feel really old to read 2012 dystopian YA books with annoying MC's and really weird love interests.\n\n\n\nCool, I wanna throw one at her.\n\nYeah, sorry not sorry, guys.\n\nSee ya in the next chapter of big hype big lie. Stay tuned."

            "review": "~ 2 stars ~\n\nThis is the most painfully underwhelming and mediocre book I have ever read in my life. If Juliette and Adam make out ONE more time, I might have to drench myself with gasoline and light myself on fire. I've read worse books. But that's not a compliment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• This book basically sidelined every important thing in this book for the romance. The romance with such an uninteresting person, that it's actually funny. They are literaly running for their lives, but somehow have time to be all lovey-dovey. There was scarcely any world-development, nor anything of substance. Like please, if you asked me what this book is about, I couldn't answer you.\n\n\n• He is so bland. Someone under one of my updates said he was as bland as white bread () and dry bread (). I liked both comparisons and very much accurate. I can't believe that he's so unamusing, that I want to know more about Warner Bros™, than him. Someone give this man a personality. Some spice. Please. Having blue eyes is not a personality trait.\n\n\n• I don't see how he can have such drastic character development. He's possessive, arrogant, and is everything I typically dislike. But at the very least, because everyone loves him, I'll grudgingly keep an open mind. Another comparison was him to soggy bread () and yes.\n\n• I don't really like her either. She had moments that I liked, but all the potential she could have had, was wasted on the romance making her seem like a love-sick child. Stop with all the touching. That's all she talks about. She just obsesses over Adam. She literally threw herself at the first man that gave her an ounce of attention and respect.\n\n• That ending was terrible. It didn't even feel like it ended. The epilogue was the same scene as the last chapter, and it added nothing. I don't feel like I read a full book, it seems like half a book.\n\n\n• it was so out of hand. It didn't make sense, and without it, I would have really liked Mafi's writing style. Not to mention the fact that some of the dialogue was absolute cringe.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• The eye color descriptions drove me crazy. Will Herondale has some tough competition. I don't understand the obsession. And they were shoved down my throat approximately every 5 pages or so as if it was relevant.\n\n\n\nThose were the main things I had an issue with, but there are definitely more. The only thing that made this digestible were the short chapters and pace. Overall, I don't think I can recommend, but so many people love this book, it just wasn't for me. But I will be continuing with the series for the sake of curiosity."

            "review": "“All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.”\n\nThe story unfolds slowly and is narrated in the first person by Juliette.\nInitially, I was confused because there were so many strikings and Juliette's obsession with numbers was something that potentially annoyed me and I didn't quite understand why it was written that way. It was only later that I realized that all of it was hinting at Juliette's state of mind, and in that aspect, it was a job well done because I didn't for a second feel like I was reading a book, it was more of reading Juliette's thoughts, getting to know more of her character, her opinions about the world, her parentage and her past as if she herself was conversing with me. I was thoroughly invested in the story, awaiting with curiosity what would happen next.\n\nThe story opens in a room with one window, four walls, and 144 square feet. Juliette is left alone, without a human being anywhere near her for about 264 days, and the reason? She has been cursed with a touch so lethal that she doesn't trust her own self around any other human entity. Later, a man who goes by the name is sent into her room and she remembers that she has known him since he was a schoolboy and that she could never forget his blue eyes. She refuses to speak to him and silently scribbles in her notebook when one day, another man, supposedly the leader of Sector 45 takes her as a prisoner (more or less), and the series of events that follow changes her life.\n\nThe characters are beautifully portrayed and Warner and Kenji had my heart from the beginning. I knew something about Warner was off, that he may not be the monster he was portrayed to be or that there's a solid reason behind why he is the way he is, and it only made me root for him.\nI don't have many thoughts about Adam. Kenji is truly one of a kind. When everyone is serious about the apprehensions of what's about to happen, he had his own ways to lighten the mood, be it with his flirtations with Juliette or swearing all the way, and successfully managed to make me smile.\n\nThe story was well-paced with equal emphasis on the characters and the plot surrounding them.\n\nA story about a girl with a magical yet lethal touch. The incinerating culture of The Reestablishment. A tale that stands out despite its cratering imperfections."

The over use of metaphors and strikeout tools caused a constant distraction, and the book was just not interesting enough for me to want to struggle through something that annoyed me so much.\n\nThe book (well what I got to, anyway) read like a super annoying IM by a 12 year old girl that just learned what a metaphor is. Do we REALLY need 50 to 100 different ways to describe his eyes? She repeats things so many times as well, and it's like she used a bunch of tools that could have been great devices had she used them once or twice. Instead she chose to beat the metaphors, strikeouts, and repetitions into your head so many times you just end up wanting to stop reading.\n\nThis book was one of the biggest disappointments of 2011 for me, and I still cannot understand why anyone would enjoy this book, let alone say this author has talent. When I read the synopsis, I thought this book sounded so good. This could have been an amazing story, but sadly the execution was horrible."

I was prepared for deranged metaphors & writing, an annoying main character, a love triangle, and a hot morally gray villain. and I got all those things, I guess. but this was still not what I was expecting at all and it was one of the weirdest books I’ve ever read.\n\nthe things that happened in this book just felt so… random?? like, she’s in an asylum, meets a guy from her past, then she’s at this fancy military center, then she’s making out with this guy, then she’s running for her life, then she’s living at this guy’s house, then she’s running for her life again, then she’s making out with a different guy, then she’s at a cliché rebellion hideout and discovers that ✨it’s all a lie✨\n\nlike, what?? mafi really took “never let them know your next move” seriously 😭\n\nthe writing itself was kind of hard to read as someone whose pet peeve is bad grammar. the run-on sentences and blatant abuse of commas and conjunctions hurt my brain. not to mention the nonsense metaphors. of them were good, but most had me literally scratching my head. it does get better as the book continues, though, and the prose becomes fairly readable over time. overall, it wasn’t a horrible reading experience.\n\n⤿\n\n\nyou all were not joking when you said she was insane. picture katniss at the end of … five times worse. I guess her insanity was portrayed well because the writing style felt almost like an intoxicated person was narrating it. she mostly got over that, though, and I look forward to seeing her character develop!\n\n\nyou all when warner sends a toddler into a torture chamber, shoots a man in the head without hesitation, and commits murder daily: 🤪🤪😋🤭😩💕💕💘💞💖💗👰‍♀️👰‍♀️💍💍💍\nlike girl… just take my credit card and sign yourself up for therapy.\n\nseriously, he was hot but had that he wasn’t hot enough to disguise. murder is not okay, kids. he was also giving insane creep and it was giving me the ick. everyone says he improves in later books, though, and I predict that I will be a warner simp soon enough.\n\n\nkind of sweet I guess? he was mostly bland but I didn’t hate him. he was just… there…\n\n\nI STAN HIM. I 100% understand the hype. it’s always the underrated side characters!! he was giving off chaotic gen z vibes and I loved it. not to mention he was actually hot… I can’t wait for more kenji content and I already love his relationship with juliette 🥹\n\n. ݁₊ ⊹ . ݁˖ . ݁\n\noverall, while this was weird and not what it would call a ,,good’’ book, per se, but it was very enjoyable and I’m excited to continue the series because literally everyone likes the later books better! on to to hopefully get the warner hype 😗\n\n\n\nily cuties <3 happy reading 🫂🩵"

Juilette was quickly declared a demon. Her parents grew to hate her. Her mother made Juliette stick her fingers in fire on her sixth birthday, just to prove her skin burned like everyone else’s. Her friends and peers abandoned her. Doctors told her she’d have to be contained for the people’s safety.\nThus the 264 days in the insane asylum.\nHowever, on Day 265, something different occurs. Juliette’s given a cellmate, a supposed reward for good behavior.\nThis new cellmate says his name’s Adam.\nAdam Kent.\nAdam tells Juliette stories of the world outside. The cardboard houses, the lack of vegetation, the dying wildlife.\nA few weeks later, the commander of Sector 45 demands Juliette’s release. The infamously ruthless commander, known only by his surname Warner, says he needs Juliette to be a weapon. A human weapon of mass destruction.\nBoth men offer vastly different futures to Juliette.\nJuliette now has to not only pull her shattered pieces back together, but she must also make a choice: the exhilarating chance to reach her full potential, or the chance to work together to save them all.\n\nbut what does each entail, and who is offering which?\n\nAAAAND if you’ve read at least the first three books you know that’s a very difficult, loaded question ;)\n\nThe storyline itself was nothing particularly mind-blowing, but it had two things that separated it from your average YA:\nthe writing was absolutely ridiculous.\nthe plot was ridiculously addictive.\nI won’t say a lot about the writing, mainly since thousands of other reviewers have expounded on how flowery (and just plain weird) it is, but it was actually only an annoyance at worst and a guilty pleasure at best.\nTHE CROSSED OUT WORDS WERE ANNOYING AS HECK THO like i know they go away after the first half, but STILL.\n\nThe plot starts a tad slow, but becomes 100% GUILTILY ADDICTIVE AND I UNASHAMEDLY LOVED IT.\n\nNO I WILL NOT DISOWN SAID OPINION ✋\n\n\nOK THE CHARACTERS EEK.\n\nThe supporting characters are half-and-half. Exactly half are flat and stupid, and the other half are GORGOUSLY AMAZING. I have too few available brain cells to talk about the flat and stupid, so we are going to skip that category. However, this second category is very important: this is where we are going to gush over Kenji.\nKENJI.\nKENJI.\nKENJI.\nKENJI.\nI LOVE YOU KENJIIII\nHe’s sarcastic, he’s hilarious, he’s an incredible leader, he’s popular, and he’s bloody the only character with a sense of humor. What literally is not to like. I could read a book just about Kenji’s favorite prank and live happily ever after.\n*sigh*\nNow, I understand you have to see/read this man to properly believe him, so I’m going to shut up about Kenji now and talk about our MCs.\n\nThe three main characters are Juliette, Adam, and Warner.\n\nJuliette Ferrars.\nI know a lot of people have complained about Juliette, but for what she went through, that girl has every reason to be a tad crazed and definitely socially challenged.\nLet us look at this from a real-life medical perspective: Juliette has almost never touched another human because any contact with her skin longer than about ten seconds kills said other human. According to Web MD, if we as humans don’t have enough touch with other humans, we can become more stressed, anxious, and depressed. Without positive experiences with touching others, we struggle making emotional connections with other humans. The article even says “long-term touch deprivation can even trigger post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\"\nand Juliette has all of those.\nso THERE juliette haters *grins satisfiedly*\n\nIn this book, Juliette’s personal character arc is learning to live in the real world. In Unravel Me, she learns to find her own identity and her own life outside of others, but that’s a story for a different review. Here, Juliette is taking baby steps. Trust me. She gets so much stronger and more authoritative ;)\n\nNext, Warner. (no, i will definitely not be telling you what his first name is *wink wink*)\nWhen I read Shatter Me, I did not see any appeal in Warner whatsoever.\nHOWEVER.\nA little after reading Unravel Me (#2) and DEFINITELY after reading Ignite Me (#3), Warner has made me fall hopelessly in love with him. I know. If all you read is this book, it’s impossible to understand how on earth millions have fallen for this man.\nTrust me again. It will make sense later ;) ❤️\n\nand last and most certainly least, Adam Kent.\nJust ew. In this book he’s ew, and the other books he’s ew. He gets more ew as the trilogy goes on. Ew.\nWe don’t stan a non-supportive and overprotective “boyfriend” 🙄🙄\nGoodbye and good riddance to you, Kent boy.\n\n\nALRIGHT THAT’S IT. THAT’S ALL I GOT.\nI want to say so much more, but just go read Shatter Me. Even if you don’t like the first one, do keep reading. It gets so so much better. I liked each book better than the one before it.\n\nlol trust me for like the third time ok, i need more people to fangirl over Ignite Me (#3) with :))\n\n\n\nMy reviews on Goodreads for the first Shatter Me trilogy:\n\n\n\n\nRatings:\nStar Rating: ★★★☆☆\nIf This Book Was a Movie Rating: PG-13\n\nRecommendations If You Liked This Book:\nShadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo"

I mean, did I want to punch some people in the face, throw the book out the window, and go into the book so I could laugh in their faces? Yes. But it was a super fun, easy, and short read. I wish I bought the rest of the series along with the first one so I wouldn't have to be waiting to see the characters again, but here we are I've changed my rating about three times, since I'm so indecisive, but we've come to the conclusion of 3.5 .\n\n➵ . It wasn't , but it wasn't the best either. You see this often with books that are first in the series, but I have high hopes for this one and I it'll get better since it wasn't even that terrible in the first place. It did give me a headache at the begining, but it eventually wore off. The crossed out words didn't me, since they were about aaron!! But what bother me was the numbers. Like what are you, trying to prove you're better at math than me ????\n\n➵ . Honestly, it confused the fuck out of me but that might just be because I'm slow enough to make sloths jealous. And then again, we didn't get a lot of information. I've seen some people complain about that, but it's because it's from Juliette's point of view, and she doesn't know much which is why we don't either.\n\n➵ just click with me. It's not like I didn't like the characters, I loved of them. I just didn't feel like there was any . We didn't get to know much about any of them, not even our main characters like Juliette!! So I just didn't feel a connection with them. But I know I'm going to grow to fall in love with them.\n\nOverall, this wasn't the , but it was a super easy read. I took some time to finish, but it was actually super fun. The entire book was pretty fast paced and it never really bored me so I enjoyed it! I would definitely recomend it to anyone and everyone though, because I can???? But seriously, go read this book 🤭.

Okay, that's a lie 😔. See, I felt no connection to her. There was no layers to her characters, I didn't anything for her. I'm pretty sure all I got was that she loves counting, her touch is lethal, her parents hated her, she's concerningly obsessed with Adam's blue eyes, and she's convinced she isn't insane. She wasn't annoying, but she did stutter a lot and while she gone under trauma, it gets annoying after some time you know? Like okay, stand up for yourself? But I've also heard she gets much better, so I'm really looking forward towards that. I have a lot of hopes for her.\n\n𝐀𝐝𝐚𝐦 𝐊𝐞𝐧𝐭\nhe has blue eyes.\n\n𝐀𝐚𝐫𝐨𝐧 𝐖𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐫\n\n\nMY!! MAN!!

Juliette, Adam just fell off a cliff and died, go join him!!! I've loved him since the fist chapter he was introduced? Maybe that's because my fave color is morally gray 🤭. Anyway, since yall didn't like him the first book you can Bye bye now Okay, but seriously I found his character more interesting than evil . I'm so excited to read more of him in the next books because he seriously made this book worth it. If you're hesitant to start this book, just remember him 😋.\n\n𝐊𝐞𝐧𝐣𝐢 𝐊𝐢𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐨\n\n\nmy middle name is crazy, come here baby 🤭. Okay, but I loved him.

I would to see him beat up Adam tbh, would want Juliette with him more than Mr. Y/n . I've heard him and Juliette get super close and I'm jumping to get my hands on a copy of Unravel me.

Can't say I loved this (pls don't hate me<3)\nThere was something new happening all the time, but a whole lot of nothing happened in this overall??\n\nI've seen some complaints on the writing style in Shatter me, but I will say that was a part that I definitely enjoyed with this. Are the grammatical errors annoying at times? Sure. But mostly the writing is very immersive. Through the writing you get an excellent depiction of Juliette's state of mind, her youth and inexperience with life, her fears, her perspective of herself. I think that was one excellent choice on the author's part, one amongst several poor ones.😅\n\nIn reading this, I did appreciate the shorter chapters as it felt like I was speeding through this. Although, unfortunately it also made things feel rushed. As a reader, I was lacking understanding and depth to characters, relationships and situations.\n\n\nThe setup is also very classic dystopian, nothing more, nothing less. It's truly a product of its time and felt like something I've read before. If I read this in my youth I might've loved it, but it didn't impress me now. Through most of this, I read it just to read - I was never really excited or intrigued to pick it up. It was way too dramatic for having no depth and it all felt a bit unserious at times.\n\nFor all you wondering, I have nothing to say about Aaron yet. I've understood there's a novella from his pov coming up so might have more to say about him then?? But rn, he is just giving . Adam is alright, but nothing special there either. Both of them honestly just makes me question what the hell is wrong with them that they are so obsessive about Juliette when she's as bland as white bread. Idk to each their own. Personally, my favourites are Kenji and James so far.🙂‍↕️\n\nI've understood it gets better from this point onwards, and from where this one ended I can see that the next one should be more intriguing. So I'll keep going, I promised y'all the first three after all🥲🫶\nI also haven't gotten my answer as to why Aaron is everybody's favorite book boyfriend, so the fomo is still fomo-ing, even if I might be a bit more sceptic now lol.\n_____________\n\n\nyou convinced me besties, but I am still scared to start this lol\n(🤓)"

Misunderstood and branded a freak, she is trapped in a dreary asylum, enduring the torment of complete isolation. Her fate shifts dramatically when The Reestablishment recognises her potential and decides to exploit her unique abilities, intending to use her as a formidable weapon.\n\n➸ This book wasn’t half bad! I actually really enjoyed the plot since it kept me engaged from start to finish. The writing style took a bit of getting used to, but I won’t be too harsh about it since it came out in 2011 and definitely feels different from the books I usually read today. I went in with low expectations, knowing that the series is supposed to get better as you read on. The dystopian world was really captivating, though I kind of wished the world-building had a bit more depth to it. Despite that, I found it pretty addictive and couldn’t help but keep turning the pages!\n\n\n\nis an interesting character, even if she can be a bit whiny and annoying sometimes which made it tough for me to connect with her. I think her struggles with insanity were portrayed well especially considering how long she’s been locked up. While I don’t feel a strong connection to her I can definitely see her potential for growth. I really hope she learns to stand up for herself more and I’m excited to see how she develops throughout the series. I think her journey could end up being pretty rewarding!\n\n\n\n- other than the fact he has blue eyes 🙄 was kind of sweet at the start, I guess, but then he became a bit annoying. His personality feels really bland and the whole thing with him and Juliette moved way too fast there was too much insta-love. I know I’m not supposed to like him, but he hasn’t done anything wrong so far that would make me understand why I shouldn’t.\n\n\n\nis a big mystery. He is quite literally a psycho and has this weird unsettling obsession with Juliette even though she shows absolutely no interest in him. He comes across as pretty awful in this book. I know there’s more to his character so I’ll go read which might give me a different perspective on him. Right now though, I really can’t stand him and I’m curious to see if my feelings will change as I learn more about him, but for now, he is not my favourite.\n\nI feel like Tahereh Mafi tends to overcomplicate her language and tries too hard to be poetic which can come off as a bit cringeworthy at times. Some of the dialogue was hard to follow, and the frequent use of metaphors and strikethroughs often distracted me from the main point. While not all the metaphors were bad—some were quite decent—but there were moments when I found myself rereading sentences and still not grasping their meaning. A few of the metaphors felt nonsensical leaving me puzzled instead of engaged.\n\nI feel like I might be a bit too generous giving this 3 stars but I have a good feeling that the series will improve. That said, I do think this book accomplishes what it sets out to do.\n\n\n#1 3 stars\n#1.5 3 stars\n\n────⋆.˚ ✩ ⋆˙⟡────\nEveryone has been telling me that I should read this series and I fear that if I don’t start it now I never will"

            "review": "(1.5/5)\n\nBuddy read with Layla, go check out her review!\n\n\nI went into this book with no expectations (negative expectations, really), and was somehow still disappointed. I think that's because this book has a somewhat promising premise and pitch, and an appealing cover, but simply fails to deliver.\n\n\n\nShatter Me attempts to tell the story of Juliette Ferrars, a seventeen-year-old with speshul powers living in an apocalyptic world, with a corrupt government. .\n\nDespite the fact that this all sounds very classic YA dystopia so far, it still had the capacity to be decent. I mean, a dystopian story about Doesn't that sound at least somewhat interesting, even if it relies heavily on trite tropes and purple prose?\n\nWell, it did to me, and apparently, that's too high of a standard to keep with this book.\n\n\n\nI mean, to start us off, there's the main character, Juliette. While I liked the way that her trauma was depicted in the beginning, I felt very misled about what I was expecting from her. You see, a great many people told me that Juliette was super \"sarcastic\" and \"funny\". That her character arc was amazing. The only thing I found even vaguely funny about her was her usage of strike-throughs. .\n\nShe’s bland af, her only defining character trait being that she has a \"curse\", and has suffered for it. She experiences no growth over the course of the story other than her all-consuming love for Adam, which, funny enough, also works to lessen the effects of her imprisonment?? I’m not even joking. The more time she spends with Adam, the less and repetition and repetition and c0unt1ng we see on the page. Yes, it is weird, and no, I do not have any good explanation.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of which, we have Adam. The love interest. Compared to Adam, Juliette is like the epitome of personality and vibrance. I can tell you a hundred different things about Adam and they’re all about his eyes. The deep blue orbs. The shards of ice. The stormy skies. The troubled water. The list goes on and on and on. Tahereh Mafi has seemingly no end to the number of times she can describe his eyes, and I’m honestly concerned. Not to mention, he fills the role of another trope for the Recipe of YA Dystopias™: .\n\nThe other third of the love triangle consists of Warner, the psychopath who’s irrevocably in love with Juliette. He is, of course, a part of the Corrupt Government™ aka ThE rEeStAbLiShMeNt. He, too, has many descriptions of his green eyes. Seriously. All of the descriptions of eyes need to stop.\n\n\n\nThat being said, even though this book starts off with a pretty solid beginning, things start going downhill very quickly. Both Adam and Warner are introduced within the first 15% of this book, and the romance starts being \"\"\"developed\"\"\" almost instantaneously. Of course, the progression of the romance between Juliette and Adam entails that they were childhood \"friends\" who never once spoke to each other. Oh, and they begin making out as soon as possible. Because, you know, #truelurrve!\n\n\n\nNow, this is the part where I confess that I’m a complete sucker for romantic plotlines. Usually, the case will be that I totally enjoyed a romance subplot in a book that most others believed they didn’t need. For the first time, I’m on the opposite team. However, as much as I wished that this love triangle didn’t exist, I’m afraid to say that it’s the only thing giving this book any substance. Without it, we quite literally would not have a book.\n\nyou ask? Well, I’m also disappointed to say that . At least, not in the ways that count. It's a romance book with a dystopian sub-plot. Nothing at all happens until the last 20% of the book. Not to mention, the descriptions of the Earth, which is supposed to be completely ravaged from climate change include:\n- The land is gray.\n- There are no plants.\n- The sky is gray.\n- There are no birds.\nI don’t know about you, but that sounds like the description of a four-year-old’s drawing of the moon to me, not a war and disease-torn planet.\n\nThe character development? Nonexistent.\n\n\n\nThe writing? Filled with weird, nonsensical metaphors that I'm sure are supposed to mEaN sOmEtHiNg.\n\nSo what kept me from condemning this book? Well, let’s just say, I’ve read things that are a lot worse. This book is actually alright. Amazing, even, compared to some of the dumpster fires I’ve read. Sure, maybe there are too many descriptions of frenzied make-out sessions, and ✨e y e s✨, but all things considered, this book was only slightly lower than where my expectations placed it.\n\n\n\nAll in all, I completely flew through this book. Maybe because I read it in the middle of the night, and completely lost any sense of time, but most likely because the chapters are short to prevent prolonged suffering.\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nthis was simultaneously better and worse than i expected it to be.\nrtc?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nam i really adding this to my tbr?\n\n\nam i going to regret it later/hate it?"

I've seen shatter me everywhere and I really wanted to see what the fuzz was all about. Y'all I did not like this book AT ALL. But this isn't a hate review cause I don't want to get crucified:\n\nAnywhoo, these are my thoughts on shatter me:\n\n1. Horrible writing style:\n\nThis book was so weirdly written imo, it kept repeating the same words again and again and again, AND I HATE IT SO MUCH. One time is fine, a couple of times sure, BUT EVERY 2 WORDS? no.\n\nHey Juliette, you know who is insane?\n\n\n2. Gaslighting Aaron\n\nI DO NOT fuck with him. Y'all I was prepared to kill this man every time he appeared. I know he'll probably get better in the next book but gosh he was so obnoxious in this one. You whiny little nepo baby stfu.\n\nAnd he's like obsessed with her? am I suppose to find that endearing? it's giving joe goldberg, it's giving zade\n\nmaybe you should kys, have you thought about that you blond bimbo?\n\n\n\n3. Juliette\n\n\n\nthis u? bsf. I was so annoyed bc homegirl was really about to die of starvation and she wouldn't eat still just to spite warner, I get that, fuck warner. BUT EAT GIRL\n\nQuotes:\n\n“We’re perfect for each other. You want the power. You love the feel of a weapon in your hand. You’re . . . attracted to me.” 😡😡\n\n“You could love me, you know.” He’s smiling a strange sort of smile. “We would be unstoppable. We would change the world. I could make you happy,”\n\nI only know I want to feel Warner’s neck snap between my own two hands.\n\nI’m almost too nervous to be disgusted by him.\n\n“God, Juliette, I’d follow you anywhere. You’re the only good thing left in this world.”\n\n“Of course you are. You don’t know it yet, Juliette, but you are a very bad girl,” he says, clutching his heart. “Just my type.”\n\n“You’re absolutely delicious when you’re angry.”\n\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nkinda overrated imo, I should have listened to iris and maryam. I will contionue the series bc I promised I would read until book 3. Adam was kinda shady, but the whiny little bonde? fuck that guy. Y'all I don't understand how Juliette could posibly like him I will keep y'all updated on my progress (also to my moots that love this I'm sorry)"
